How should\\nwe represent the meaning of a word? In the n-gram models of Chapter 3, and in\\nclassical NLP applications, our only representation of a word is as a string of letters,\\nor an index in a vocabulary list. This representation is not that different from a\\ntradition in philosophy, perhaps you’ve seen it in introductory logic classes, in which\\nthe meaning of words is represented by just spelling the word with small capital\\nletters; representing the meaning of “dog” as DOG, and “cat” as CAT, or by using an\\napostrophe (DOG’).\\nRepresenting the meaning of a word by capitalizing it is a pretty unsatisfactory\\nmodel. You might have seen a version of a joke due originally to semanticist Barbara\\nPartee (Carlson, 1977):\\nQ: What’s the meaning of life?\\nA: LIFE’\\nSurely we can do better than this! After all, we’ll want a model of word meaning\\nto do all sorts of things for us. It should tell us that some words have similar mean-\\nings (cat is similar to dog), others are antonyms (cold is the opposite of hot), some\\nhave positive connotations (happy) while others have negative connotations (sad). It\\nshould represent the fact that the meanings of buy, sell, and pay offer differing per-\\nspectives on the same underlying purchasing event. (If I buy something from you,\\nyou’ve probably sold it to me, and I likely paid you.) More generally, a model of\\nword meaning should allow us to draw inferences to address meaning-related tasks\\nlike question-answering or dialogue.\\nIn this section we summarize some of these desiderata, drawing on results in the\\nlinguistic study of word meaning, which is called lexical semantics; we’ll return to\\nlexical\\nsemantics\\nand expand on this list in Appendix G and Chapter 21.\\nLemmas and Senses\\nLet’s start by looking at how one word (we’ll choose mouse)\\nmight be deﬁned in a dictionary (simpliﬁed from the online dictionary WordNet):\\nmouse (N)\\n1.\\nany of numerous small rodents...\\n2.\\na hand-operated device that controls a cursor...\\nHere the form mouse is the lemma, also called the citation form. The form\\nlemma\\ncitation form\\nmouse would also be the lemma for the word mice; dictionaries don’t have separate\\ndeﬁnitions for inﬂected forms like mice. Similarly sing is the lemma for sing, sang,\\nsung. In many languages the inﬁnitive form is used as the lemma for the verb, so\\nSpanish dormir “to sleep” is the lemma for duermes “you sleep”. The speciﬁc forms\\nsung or carpets or sing or duermes are called wordforms.\\nwordform\\nAs the example above shows, each lemma can have multiple meanings; the\\nlemma mouse can refer to the rodent or the cursor control device. We call each\\nof these aspects of the meaning of mouse a word sense. The fact that lemmas can\\nbe polysemous (have multiple senses) can make interpretation difﬁcult (is some-\\none who searches for “mouse info” looking for a pet or a widget?). Chapter 10\\nand Appendix G will discuss the problem of polysemy, and introduce word sense\\ndisambiguation, the task of determining which sense of a word is being used in a\\nparticular context.\\nSynonymy\\nOne important component of word meaning is the relationship be-\\ntween word senses. For example when one word has a sense whose meaning is'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.21', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2025-08-24T11:50:50-07:00', 'source': 'data\\\\embeddings.pdf', 'file_path': 'data\\\\embeddings.pdf', 'total_pages': 27, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2025-08-24T11:50:50-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20250824115050-07'00'\", 'creationDate': \"D:20250824115050-07'00'\", 'page': 2}, page_content='5.1\\n•\\nLEXICAL SEMANTICS\\n3\\nidentical to a sense of another word, or nearly identical, we say the two senses of\\nthose two words are synonyms. Synonyms include such pairs as\\nsynonym\\ncouch/sofa vomit/throw up ﬁlbert/hazelnut car/automobile\\nA more formal deﬁnition of synonymy (between words rather than senses) is that\\ntwo words are synonymous if they are substitutable for one another in any sentence\\nwithout changing the truth conditions of the sentence, the situations in which the\\nsentence would be true.\\nWhile substitutions between some pairs of words like car / automobile or wa-\\nter / H2O are truth preserving, the words are still not identical in meaning. Indeed,\\nprobably no two words are absolutely identical in meaning. One of the fundamental\\ntenets of semantics, called the principle of contrast (Girard 1718, Br´eal 1897, Clark\\nprinciple of\\ncontrast\\n1987), states that a difference in linguistic form is always associated with some dif-\\nference in meaning. For example, the word H2O is used in scientiﬁc contexts and\\nwould be inappropriate in a hiking guide—water would be more appropriate— and\\nthis genre difference is part of the meaning of the word. In practice, the word syn-\\nonym is therefore used to describe a relationship of approximate or rough synonymy.\\nWord Similarity\\nWhile words don’t have many synonyms, most words do have\\nlots of similar words. Cat is not a synonym of dog, but cats and dogs are certainly\\nsimilar words. In moving from synonymy to similarity, it will be useful to shift from\\ntalking about relations between word senses (like synonymy) to relations between\\nwords (like similarity). Dealing with words avoids having to commit to a particular\\nrepresentation of word senses, which will turn out to simplify our task.\\nThe notion of word similarity is very useful in larger semantic tasks. Knowing\\nsimilarity\\nhow similar two words are can help in computing how similar the meaning of two\\nphrases or sentences are, a very important component of tasks like question answer-\\ning, paraphrasing, and summarization. One way of getting values for word similarity\\nis to ask humans to judge how similar one word is to another. A number of datasets\\nhave resulted from such experiments. For example the SimLex-999 dataset (Hill\\net al., 2015) gives values on a scale from 0 to 10, like the examples below, which\\nrange from near-synonyms (vanish, disappear) to pairs that scarcely seem to have\\nanything in common (hole, agreement):\\nvanish\\ndisappear\\n9.8\\nbelief\\nimpression 5.95\\nmuscle bone\\n3.65\\nmodest ﬂexible\\n0.98\\nhole\\nagreement\\n0.3\\nWord Relatedness\\nThe meaning of two words can be related in ways other than\\nsimilarity. One such class of connections is called word relatedness (Budanitsky\\nrelatedness\\nand Hirst, 2006), also traditionally called word association in psychology.\\nassociation\\nConsider the meanings of the words coffee and cup. Coffee is not similar to cup;\\nthey share practically no features (coffee is a plant or a beverage, while a cup is a\\nmanufactured object with a particular shape). But coffee and cup are clearly related;\\nthey are associated by co-participating in an everyday event (the event of drinking\\ncoffee out of a cup). Similarly scalpel and surgeon are not similar but are related\\neventively (a surgeon tends to make use of a scalpel).\\nOne common kind of relatedness between words is if they belong to the same\\nsemantic ﬁeld. A semantic ﬁeld is a set of words which cover a particular semantic\\nsemantic ﬁeld\\ndomain and bear structured relations with each other.

Semantic ﬁelds are also related to topic models, like Latent\\ntopic models\\nDirichlet Allocation, LDA, which apply unsupervised learning on large sets of texts\\nto induce sets of associated words from text. Semantic ﬁelds and topic models are\\nvery useful tools for discovering topical structure in documents.\\nIn Appendix G we’ll introduce more relations between senses like hypernymy\\nor IS-A, antonymy (opposites) and meronymy (part-whole relations).\\nConnotation\\nFinally, words have affective meanings or connotations. The word\\nconnotations\\nconnotation has different meanings in different ﬁelds, but here we use it to mean the\\naspects of a word’s meaning that are related to a writer or reader’s emotions, senti-\\nment, opinions, or evaluations. For example some words have positive connotations\\n(wonderful) while others have negative connotations (dreary). Even words whose\\nmeanings are similar in other ways can vary in connotation; consider the difference\\nin connotations between fake, knockoff, forgery, on the one hand, and copy, replica,\\nreproduction on the other, or innocent (positive connotation) and naive (negative\\nconnotation). Some words describe positive evaluation (great, love) and others neg-\\native evaluation (terrible, hate). Positive or negative evaluation language is called\\nsentiment, as we saw in Appendix K, and word sentiment plays a role in impor-\\nsentiment\\ntant tasks like sentiment analysis, stance detection, and applications of NLP to the\\nlanguage of politics and consumer reviews.\\nEarly work on affective meaning (Osgood et al., 1957) found that words varied\\nalong three important dimensions of affective meaning:\\nvalence: the pleasantness of the stimulus\\narousal: the intensity of emotion provoked by the stimulus\\ndominance: the degree of control exerted by the stimulus\\nThus words like happy or satisﬁed are high on valence, while unhappy or an-\\nnoyed are low on valence. Excited is high on arousal, while calm is low on arousal.\\nControlling is high on dominance, while awed or inﬂuenced are low on dominance.\\nEach word is thus represented by three numbers, corresponding to its value on each\\nof the three dimensions:\\nValence Arousal Dominance\\ncourageous 8.0\\n5.5\\n7.4\\nmusic\\n7.7\\n5.6\\n6.5\\nheartbreak\\n2.5\\n5.7\\n3.6\\ncub\\n6.7\\n4.0\\n4.2\\nOsgood et al. (1957) noticed that in using these 3 numbers to represent the\\nmeaning of a word, the model was representing each word as a point in a three-\\ndimensional space, a vector whose three dimensions corresponded to the word’s\\nrating on the three scales. This revolutionary idea that word meaning could be rep-\\nresented as a point in space (e.g., that part of the meaning of heartbreak can be\\nrepresented as the point [2.5,5.7,3.6]) was the ﬁrst expression of the vector seman-\\ntics models that we introduce next.\\n5.2\\nVector Semantics: The Intuition\\nVector semantics is the standard way to represent word meaning in NLP, helping\\nvector\\nsemantics'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.21', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2025-08-24T11:50:50-07:00', 'source': 'data\\\\embeddings.pdf', 'file_path': 'data\\\\embeddings.pdf', 'total_pages': 27, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2025-08-24T11:50:50-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20250824115050-07'00'\", 'creationDate': \"D:20250824115050-07'00'\", 'page': 4}, page_content='5.2\\n•\\nVECTOR SEMANTICS: THE INTUITION\\n5\\nus model many of the aspects of word meaning we saw in the previous section. The\\nroots of the model lie in the 1950s when two big ideas converged: Osgood’s 1957\\nidea mentioned above to use a point in three-dimensional space to represent the\\nconnotation of a word, and the proposal by linguists like Joos (1950), Harris (1954),\\nand Firth (1957) to deﬁne the meaning of a word by its distribution in language\\nuse, meaning its neighboring words or grammatical environments. Their idea was\\nthat two words that occur in very similar distributions (whose neighboring words are\\nsimilar) have similar meanings.\\nFor example, suppose you didn’t know the meaning of the word ongchoi (a re-\\ncent borrowing from Cantonese) but you see it in the following contexts:\\n(5.1) Ongchoi is delicious sauteed with garlic.\\n(5.2) Ongchoi is superb over rice.\\n(5.3) ...ongchoi leaves with salty sauces...\\nAnd suppose that you had seen many of these context words in other contexts:\\n(5.4) ...spinach sauteed with garlic over rice...\\n(5.5) ...chard stems and leaves are delicious...\\n(5.6) ...collard greens and other salty leafy greens\\nThe fact that ongchoi occurs with words like rice and garlic and delicious and\\nsalty, as do words like spinach, chard, and collard greens might suggest that ongchoi\\nis a leafy green similar to these other leafy greens.1 We can implement the same\\nintuition computationally by just counting words in the context of ongchoi.\\nFigure 5.1\\nA two-dimensional (t-SNE) visualization of 200-dimensional word2vec em-\\nbeddings for some words close to the word sweet, showing that words with similar mean-\\nings are nearby in space.

Vectors for representing words are called embeddings.\\nembeddings\\nThe word “embedding” derives historically from its mathematical sense as a map-\\nping from one space or structure to another, although the meaning has shifted; see\\nthe end of the chapter.\\nFig. 5.1 shows a visualization of embeddings learned by the word2vec algorithm,\\nshowing the location of selected words (neighbors of “sweet”) projected down from\\n1\\nIt’s in fact Ipomoea aquatica, a relative of morning glory sometimes called water spinach in English.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.21', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2025-08-24T11:50:50-07:00', 'source': 'data\\\\embeddings.pdf', 'file_path': 'data\\\\embeddings.pdf', 'total_pages': 27, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2025-08-24T11:50:50-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20250824115050-07'00'\", 'creationDate': \"D:20250824115050-07'00'\", 'page': 5}, page_content='6\\nCHAPTER 5\\n•\\nEMBEDDINGS\\n200-dimensional space into a 2-dimensional space. Note that the nearest neighbors\\nof sweet are semantically related words like honey, candy, juice, chocolate. This idea\\nthat similar words are near each other in high-dimensional space is an important\\nthat offers enormous power to language models and other NLP applications. For\\nexample the sentiment classiﬁers of Chapter 4 depend on the same words appearing\\nin the training and test sets. But by representing words as embeddings, a classiﬁer\\ncan assign sentiment as long as it sees some words with similar meanings. And as\\nwe’ll see, vector semantic models like the ones showed in Fig. 5.1 can be learned\\nautomatically from text without supervision.\\nIn this chapter we’ll begin with a simple pedagogical model of embeddings in\\nwhich the meaning of a word is deﬁned by a vector with the counts of nearby words.\\nWe introduce this model as a helpful way to understand the concept of vectors and\\nwhat it means for a vector to be a representation of word meaning, but more sophis-\\nticated variants like the tf-idf model we will introduce in Chapter 11 are important\\nmethods you should understand. We will see that this method results in very long\\nvectors that are sparse, i.e. mostly zeros (since most words simply never occur in the\\ncontext of others). We’ll then introduce the word2vec model family for constructing\\nshort, dense vectors that have even more useful semantic properties.\\nWe’ll also introduce the cosine, the standard way to use embeddings to com-\\npute semantic similarity, between two words, two sentences, or two documents, an\\nimportant tool in practical applications.\\n5.3\\nSimple count-based embeddings\\n“The most important attributes of a vector in 3-space are {Location, Location, Location}”\\nRandall Munroe, the hover from https://xkcd.com/2358/\\nLet’s now introduce the ﬁrst way to compute word vector embeddings. This sim-\\nplest vector model of meaning is based on the co-occurrence matrix, a way of rep-\\nresenting how often words co-occur. We’ll deﬁne a particular kind of co-occurrence\\nmatrix, the word-context matrix, in which each row in the matrix represents a word\\nword-context\\nmatrix\\nin the vocabulary and each column represents how often each other word in the vo-\\ncabulary appears nearby. This matrix is thus of dimensionality |V| × |V| and each\\ncell records the number of times the row (target) word and the column (context)\\nword co-occur nearby in some training corpus.\\nWhat do we mean by ‘nearby’? We could implement various methods, but let’s\\nstart with a very simple one: a context window around the word, let’s say of 4 words\\nto the left and 4 words to the right.

To review some basic linear\\nalgebra, a vector is, at heart, just a list or array of numbers. So cherry is represented\\nvector\\nas the list [1,0,1] (the ﬁrst row vector in Fig. 5.2) and information is represented as\\nthe list [1,1,0] (the fourth row vector).\\nA vector space is a collection of vectors, and is characterized by its dimension.\\nvector space\\ndimension\\nVectors in a 3-dimensional vector space have an element for each dimension of the\\nspace.

The raw dot product\\nthus will be higher for frequent words. But this is a problem; we’d like a similarity\\nmetric that tells us how similar two words are regardless of their frequency.\\nWe modify the dot product to normalize for the vector length by dividing the\\ndot product by the lengths of each of the two vectors. This normalized dot product\\nturns out to be the same as the cosine of the angle between the two vectors, following\\nfrom the deﬁnition of the dot product between two vectors a and b:\\na·b = |a||b|cosθ\\na·b\\n|a||b| = cosθ\\n(5.9)\\nThe cosine similarity metric between two vectors v and w thus can be computed as:\\ncosine\\ncosine(v,w) = v ·w\\n|v||w| =\\nN\\nX\\ni=1\\nviwi\\nv\\nu\\nu\\nt\\nN\\nX\\ni=1\\nv2\\ni\\nv\\nu\\nu\\nt\\nN\\nX\\ni=1\\nw2\\ni\\n(5.10)\\nFor some applications we pre-normalize each vector, by dividing it by its length,\\ncreating a unit vector of length 1.

We now introduce a more\\npowerful word representation: embeddings, short dense vectors. Unlike the vectors\\nwe’ve seen so far, embeddings are short, with number of dimensions d ranging from\\n50-1000, rather than the much larger vocabulary size |V|.These d dimensions don’t\\nhave a clear interpretation. And the vectors are dense: instead of vector entries\\nbeing sparse, mostly-zero counts or functions of counts, the values will be real-\\nvalued numbers that can be negative.\\nIt turns out that dense vectors work better in every NLP task than sparse vectors.\\nWhile we don’t completely understand all the reasons for this, we have some intu-\\nitions. Representing words as 300-dimensional dense vectors requires our classiﬁers\\nto learn far fewer weights than if we represented words as 50,000-dimensional vec-\\ntors, and the smaller parameter space possibly helps with generalization and avoid-\\ning overﬁtting. Dense vectors may also do a better job of capturing synonymy.\\nFor example, in a sparse vector representation, dimensions for synonyms like car\\nand automobile dimension are distinct and unrelated; sparse vectors may thus fail\\nto capture the similarity between a word with car as a neighbor and a word with\\nautomobile as a neighbor.\\nIn this section we introduce one method for computing embeddings: skip-gram\\nskip-gram\\nwith negative sampling, sometimes called SGNS. The skip-gram algorithm is one\\nSGNS\\nof two algorithms in a software package called word2vec, and so sometimes the\\nword2vec\\nalgorithm is loosely referred to as word2vec (Mikolov et al. 2013a, Mikolov et al.\\n2013b).

In Chapter 10 we’ll introduce methods for learning dynamic contextual\\nembeddings like the popular family of BERT representations, in which the vector\\nfor each word is different in different contexts.\\nThe intuition of word2vec is that instead of counting how often each word w oc-\\ncurs near, say, apricot, we’ll instead train a classiﬁer on a binary prediction task: “Is\\nword w likely to show up near apricot?” We don’t actually care about this prediction\\ntask; instead we’ll take the learned classiﬁer weights as the word embeddings.\\nThe revolutionary intuition here is that we can just use running text as implicitly\\nsupervised training data for such a classiﬁer; a word c that occurs near the target\\nword apricot acts as gold ‘correct answer’ to the question “Is word c likely to show\\nup near apricot?” This method, often called self-supervision, avoids the need for\\nself-supervision\\nany sort of hand-labeled supervision signal. This idea was ﬁrst proposed in the task\\nof neural language modeling, when Bengio et al. (2003) and Collobert et al. (2011)\\nshowed that a neural language model (a neural network that learned to predict the\\nnext word from prior words) could just use the next word in running text as its\\nsupervision signal, and could be used to learn an embedding representation for each\\nword as part of doing this prediction task.\\nWe’ll see how to do neural networks in the next chapter, but word2vec is a\\nmuch simpler model than the neural network language model, in two ways. First,\\nword2vec simpliﬁes the task (making it binary classiﬁcation instead of word pre-\\ndiction). Second, word2vec simpliﬁes the architecture (training a logistic regression\\nclassiﬁer instead of a multi-layer neural network with hidden layers that demand\\nmore sophisticated training algorithms). The intuition of skip-gram is:\\n1. Treat the target word and a neighboring context word as positive examples.\\n2. Randomly sample other words in the lexicon to get negative samples.\\n3.

An extension of word2vec, fasttext\\nfasttext\\n(Bojanowski et al., 2017), addresses a problem with word2vec as we have presented\\nit so far: it has no good way to deal with unknown words—words that appear in\\na test corpus but were unseen in the training corpus. A related problem is word\\nsparsity, such as in languages with rich morphology, where some of the many forms\\nfor each noun and verb may only occur rarely. Fasttext deals with these problems\\nby using subword models, representing each word as itself plus a bag of constituent\\nn-grams, with special boundary symbols < and > added to each word. For example,\\nwith n = 3 the word where would be represented by the sequence <where> plus the\\ncharacter n-grams:\\n<wh, whe, her, ere, re>\\nThen a skipgram embedding is learned for each constituent n-gram, and the word\\nwhere is represented by the sum of all of the embeddings of its constituent n-grams.\\nUnknown words can then be presented only by the sum of the constituent n-grams.\\nA fasttext open-source library, including pretrained embeddings for 157 languages,\\nis available at https://fasttext.cc.\\nAnother very widely used static embedding model is GloVe (Pennington et al.,\\n2014), short for Global Vectors, because the model is based on capturing global\\ncorpus statistics. GloVe is based on ratios of probabilities from the word-word co-\\noccurrence matrix.\\nIt turns out that dense embeddings like word2vec actually have an elegant math-\\nematical relationship with count-based embeddings, in which word2vec can be seen\\nas implicitly optimizing a function of a count matrix with a particular (PPMI) weight-\\ning (Levy and Goldberg, 2014c).\\n5.6\\nVisualizing Embeddings\\n“I see well in many dimensions as long as the dimensions are around two.”\\nThe late economist Martin Shubik\\nVisualizing embeddings is an important goal in helping understand, apply, and\\nimprove these models of word meaning.

For example the 7 closest\\nwords to frog using a particular embeddings computed with\\nthe GloVe algorithm are: frogs, toad, litoria, leptodactyli-\\ndae, rana, lizard, and eleutherodactylus (Pennington et al.,\\n2014).\\nYet another visualization method is to use a clustering\\nalgorithm to show a hierarchical representation of which\\nwords are similar to others in the embedding space.

Fig. 5.1 showed one such visualization, as does\\nFig. 5.9, using a projection method called t-SNE (van der\\nMaaten and Hinton, 2008).\\n5.7\\nSemantic properties of embeddings\\nIn this section we brieﬂy summarize some of the semantic properties of embeddings\\nthat have been studied.\\nDifferent types of similarity or association:\\nOne parameter of vector semantic\\nmodels that is relevant to both sparse PPMI vectors and dense word2vec vectors is\\nthe size of the context window used to collect counts. This is generally between 1\\nand 10 words on each side of the target word (for a total context of 2-20 words).\\nThe choice depends on the goals of the representation. Shorter context windows\\ntend to lead to representations that are a bit more syntactic, since the information is\\ncoming from immediately nearby words. When the vectors are computed from short\\ncontext windows, the most similar words to a target word w tend to be semantically\\nsimilar words with the same parts of speech. When vectors are computed from long\\ncontext windows, the highest cosine words to a target word w tend to be words that\\nare topically related but not similar.\\nFor example Levy and Goldberg (2014a) showed that using skip-gram with a\\nwindow of ±2, the most similar words to the word Hogwarts (from the Harry Potter\\nseries) were names of other ﬁctional schools: Sunnydale (from Buffy the Vampire\\nSlayer) or Evernight (from a vampire series). With a window of ±5, the most similar\\nwords to Hogwarts were other words topically related to the Harry Potter series:\\nDumbledore, Malfoy, and half-blood.\\nIt’s also often useful to distinguish two kinds of similarity or association between\\nwords (Sch¨utze and Pedersen, 1993). Two words have ﬁrst-order co-occurrence\\nﬁrst-order\\nco-occurrence\\n(sometimes called syntagmatic association) if they are typically nearby each other.\\nThus wrote is a ﬁrst-order associate of book or poem. Two words have second-order\\nco-occurrence (sometimes called paradigmatic association) if they have similar\\nsecond-order\\nco-occurrence\\nneighbors. Thus wrote is a second-order associate of words like said or remarked.\\nAnalogy/Relational Similarity:\\nAnother semantic property of embeddings is their\\nability to capture relational meanings. In an important early vector space model of\\ncognition, Rumelhart and Abrahamson (1973) proposed the parallelogram model\\nparallelogram\\nmodel\\nfor solving simple analogy problems of the form a is to b as a* is to what?. In such\\nproblems, a system is given a problem like apple:tree::grape:?, i.e., apple is to tree\\nas grape is to\\n, and must ﬁll in the word vine. In the parallelogram model, il-\\nlustrated in Fig. 5.8, the vector from the word apple to the word tree (= #   »\\ntree−#       »\\napple)\\nis added to the vector for grape (#        »\\ngrape); the nearest word to that point is returned.\\nIn early work with sparse embeddings, scholars showed that sparse vector mod-\\nels of meaning could solve such analogy problems (Turney and Littman, 2005),\\nbut the parallelogram method received more modern attention because of its suc-\\ncess with word2vec or GloVe vectors (Mikolov et al. 2013c, Levy and Goldberg\\n2014b, Pennington et al. 2014). For example, the result of the expression #     »\\nking −\\n#     »\\nman + #            »\\nwoman is a vector close to #         »\\nqueen. Similarly, #      »\\nParis −#           »\\nFrance + #     »\\nItaly results\\nin a vector that is close to #         »\\nRome.

For example Fig. 5.10 shows a visualization of changes in meaning in\\nEnglish words over the last two centuries, computed by building separate embedding\\nspaces for each decade from historical corpora like Google n-grams (Lin et al., 2012)\\nand the Corpus of Historical American English (Davies, 2012).\\nFigure 5.10\\nA t-SNE visualization of the semantic change of 3 words in English using\\nword2vec vectors. The modern sense of each word, and the grey context words, are com-\\nputed from the most recent (modern) time-point embedding space. Earlier points are com-\\nputed from earlier historical embedding spaces. The visualizations show the changes in the\\nword gay from meanings related to “cheerful” or “frolicsome” to referring to homosexuality,\\nthe development of the modern “transmission” sense of broadcast from its original sense of\\nsowing seeds, and the pejoration of the word awful as it shifted from meaning “full of awe”\\nto meaning “terrible or appalling” (Hamilton et al., 2016).\\n5.8\\nBias and Embeddings\\nIn addition to their ability to learn word meaning from text, embeddings, alas,\\nalso reproduce the implicit biases and stereotypes that were latent in the text. As\\nthe prior section just showed, embeddings can roughly model relational similar-\\nity: ‘queen’ as the closest word to ‘king’ - ‘man’ + ‘woman’ implies the analogy\\nman:woman::king:queen. But these same embedding analogies also exhibit gender\\nstereotypes. For example Bolukbasi et al. (2016) ﬁnd that the closest occupation\\nto ‘computer programmer’ - ‘man’ + ‘woman’ in word2vec embeddings trained on\\nnews text is ‘homemaker’, and that the embeddings similarly suggest the analogy\\n‘father’ is to ‘doctor’ as ‘mother’ is to ‘nurse’. This could result in what Crawford\\n(2017) and Blodgett et al. (2020) call an allocational harm, when a system allo-\\nallocational\\nharm\\ncates resources (jobs or credit) unfairly to different groups. For example algorithms\\nthat use embeddings as part of a search for hiring potential programmers or doctors\\nmight thus incorrectly downweight documents with women’s names.\\nIt turns out that embeddings don’t just reﬂect the statistics of their input, but also\\namplify bias; gendered terms become more gendered in embedding space than they\\nbias\\nampliﬁcation\\nwere in the input text statistics (Zhao et al. 2017, Ethayarajh et al. 2019b, Jia et al.\\n2020), and biases are more exaggerated than in actual labor employment statistics\\n(Garg et al., 2018).\\nEmbeddings also encode the implicit associations that are a property of human\\nreasoning.

Caliskan\\net al. (2017) replicated all these ﬁndings of implicit associations using GloVe vectors\\nand cosine similarity instead of human latencies. For example African-American\\nnames like ‘Leroy’ and ‘Shaniqua’ had a higher GloVe cosine with unpleasant words\\nwhile European-American names (‘Brad’, ‘Greg’, ‘Courtney’) had a higher cosine\\nwith pleasant words. These problems with embeddings are an example of a repre-\\nsentational harm (Crawford 2017, Blodgett et al. 2020), which is a harm caused by\\nrepresentational\\nharm\\na system demeaning or even ignoring some social groups. Any embedding-aware al-\\ngorithm that made use of word sentiment could thus exacerbate bias against African\\nAmericans.\\nRecent research focuses on ways to try to remove these kinds of biases, for\\nexample by developing a transformation of the embedding space that removes gen-\\nder stereotypes but preserves deﬁnitional gender (Bolukbasi et al. 2016, Zhao et al.\\n2017) or changing the training procedure (Zhao et al., 2018). However, although\\nthese sorts of debiasing may reduce bias in embeddings, they do not eliminate it\\ndebiasing\\n(Gonen and Goldberg, 2019), and this remains an open problem.\\nHistorical embeddings are also being used to measure biases in the past. Garg\\net al. (2018) used embeddings from historical texts to measure the association be-\\ntween embeddings for occupations and embeddings for names of various ethnici-\\nties or genders (for example the relative cosine similarity of women’s names versus\\nmen’s to occupation words like ‘librarian’ or ‘carpenter’) across the 20th century.\\nThey found that the cosines correlate with the empirical historical percentages of\\nwomen or ethnic groups in those occupations. Historical embeddings also repli-\\ncated old surveys of ethnic stereotypes; the tendency of experimental participants in\\n1933 to associate adjectives like ‘industrious’ or ‘superstitious’ with, e.g., Chinese\\nethnicity, correlates with the cosine between Chinese last names and those adjectives\\nusing embeddings trained on 1930s text. They also were able to document historical\\ngender biases, such as the fact that embeddings for adjectives related to competence\\n(‘smart’, ‘wise’, ‘thoughtful’, ‘resourceful’) had a higher cosine with male than fe-\\nmale words, and showed that this bias has been slowly decreasing since 1960. We\\nreturn in later chapters to this question about the role of bias in natural language\\nprocessing.\\n5.9\\nEvaluating Vector Models\\nThe most important evaluation metric for vector models is extrinsic evaluation on\\ntasks, i.e., using vectors in an NLP task and seeing whether this improves perfor-\\nmance over some other model.\\n3\\nRoughly speaking, if humans associate ‘ﬂowers’ with ‘pleasantness’ and ‘insects’ with ‘unpleasant-\\nness’, when they are instructed to push a green button for ‘ﬂowers’ (daisy, iris, lilac) and ‘pleasant words’\\n(love, laughter, pleasure) and a red button for ‘insects’ (ﬂea, spider, mosquito) and ‘unpleasant words’\\n(abuse, hatred, ugly) they are faster than in an incongruous condition where they push a red button for\\n‘ﬂowers’ and ‘unpleasant words’ and a green button for ‘insects’ and ‘pleasant words’.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.21', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2025-08-24T11:50:50-07:00', 'source': 'data\\\\embeddings.pdf', 'file_path': 'data\\\\embeddings.pdf', 'total_pages': 27, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2025-08-24T11:50:50-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20250824115050-07'00'\", 'creationDate': \"D:20250824115050-07'00'\", 'page': 20}, page_content='5.10\\n•\\nSUMMARY\\n21\\nNonetheless it is useful to have intrinsic evaluations. The most common metric\\nis to test their performance on similarity, computing the correlation between an\\nalgorithm’s word similarity scores and word similarity ratings assigned by humans.\\nWordSim-353 (Finkelstein et al., 2002) is a commonly used set of ratings from 0\\nto 10 for 353 noun pairs; for example (plane, car) had an average score of 5.77.\\nSimLex-999 (Hill et al., 2015) is a more complex dataset that quantiﬁes similarity\\n(cup, mug) rather than relatedness (cup, coffee), and includes concrete and abstract\\nadjective, noun and verb pairs. The TOEFL dataset is a set of 80 questions, each\\nconsisting of a target word with 4 additional word choices; the task is to choose\\nwhich is the correct synonym, as in the example: Levied is closest in meaning to:\\nimposed, believed, requested, correlated (Landauer and Dumais, 1997). All of these\\ndatasets present words without context.\\nSlightly more realistic are intrinsic similarity tasks that include context. The\\nStanford Contextual Word Similarity (SCWS) dataset (Huang et al., 2012) and the\\nWord-in-Context (WiC) dataset (Pilehvar and Camacho-Collados, 2019) offer richer\\nevaluation scenarios. SCWS gives human judgments on 2,003 pairs of words in\\ntheir sentential context, while WiC gives target words in two sentential contexts that\\nare either in the same or different senses; see Appendix G. The semantic textual\\nsimilarity task (Agirre et al. 2012, Agirre et al. 2015) evaluates the performance of\\nsentence-level similarity algorithms, consisting of a set of pairs of sentences, each\\npair with human-labeled similarity scores.\\nAnother task used for evaluation is the analogy task, discussed on page 17, where\\nthe system has to solve problems of the form a is to b as a* is to b*, given a, b, and a*\\nand having to ﬁnd b* (Turney and Littman, 2005). A number of sets of tuples have\\nbeen created for this task (Mikolov et al. 2013a, Mikolov et al. 2013c, Gladkova\\net al. 2016), covering morphology (city:cities::child:children), lexicographic rela-\\ntions (leg:table::spout:teapot) and encyclopedia relations (Beijing:China::Dublin:Ireland),\\nsome drawing from the SemEval-2012 Task 2 dataset of 79 different relations (Jur-\\ngens et al., 2012).\\nAll embedding algorithms suffer from inherent variability. For example because\\nof randomness in the initialization and the random negative sampling, algorithms\\nlike word2vec may produce different results even from the same dataset, and in-\\ndividual documents in a collection may strongly impact the resulting embeddings\\n(Tian et al. 2016, Hellrich and Hahn 2016, Antoniak and Mimno 2018). When em-\\nbeddings are used to study word associations in particular corpora, therefore, it is\\nbest practice to train multiple embeddings with bootstrap sampling over documents\\nand average the results (Antoniak and Mimno, 2018).\\n5.10\\nSummary\\n• In vector semantics, a word is modeled as a vector—a point in high-dimensional\\nspace, also called an embedding. In this chapter we focus on static embed-\\ndings, where each word is mapped to a ﬁxed embedding.\\n• Vector semantic models fall into two classes: sparse and dense. In sparse\\nmodels each dimension corresponds to a word in the vocabulary V and cells\\nare functions of co-occurrence counts. The word-context or term-term ma-\\ntrix has a row for each (target) word in the vocabulary and a column for each\\ncontext term in the vocabulary.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.21', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2025-08-24T11:50:50-07:00', 'source': 'data\\\\embeddings.pdf', 'file_path': 'data\\\\embeddings.pdf', 'total_pages': 27, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2025-08-24T11:50:50-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20250824115050-07'00'\", 'creationDate': \"D:20250824115050-07'00'\", 'page': 21}, page_content='22\\nCHAPTER 5\\n•\\nEMBEDDINGS\\n• Dense vector models typically have dimensionality 50–1000. Word2vec al-\\ngorithms like skip-gram are a popular way to compute dense embeddings.\\nSkip-gram trains a logistic regression classiﬁer to compute the probability that\\ntwo words are ‘likely to occur nearby in text’. This probability is computed\\nfrom the dot product between the embeddings for the two words.\\n• Skip-gram uses stochastic gradient descent to train the classiﬁer, by learning\\nembeddings that have a high dot product with embeddings of words that occur\\nnearby and a low dot product with noise words.\\n• Other important embedding algorithms include GloVe, a method based on\\nratios of word co-occurrence probabilities.\\n• Whether using sparse or dense vectors, word and document similarities are\\ncomputed by some function of the dot product between vectors. The cosine\\nof two vectors—a normalized dot product—is the most popular such metric.\\nHistorical Notes\\nThe idea of vector semantics arose out of research in the 1950s in three distinct\\nﬁelds: linguistics, psychology, and computer science, each of which contributed a\\nfundamental aspect of the model.\\nThe idea that meaning is related to the distribution of words in context was\\nwidespread in linguistic theory of the 1950s, among distributionalists like Zellig\\nHarris, Martin Joos, and J. R. Firth, and semioticians like Thomas Sebeok. As Joos\\n(1950) put it,\\nthe linguist’s “meaning” of a morpheme. . . is by deﬁnition the set of conditional\\nprobabilities of its occurrence in context with all other morphemes.\\nThe idea that the meaning of a word might be modeled as a point in a multi-\\ndimensional semantic space came from psychologists like Charles E. Osgood, who\\nhad been studying how people responded to the meaning of words by assigning val-\\nues along scales like happy/sad or hard/soft. Osgood et al. (1957) proposed that the\\nmeaning of a word in general could be modeled as a point in a multidimensional\\nEuclidean space, and that the similarity of meaning between two words could be\\nmodeled as the distance between these points in the space.\\nA ﬁnal intellectual source in the 1950s and early 1960s was the ﬁeld then called\\nmechanical indexing, now known as information retrieval. In what became known\\nmechanical\\nindexing\\nas the vector space model for information retrieval (Salton 1971, Sparck Jones\\n1986), researchers demonstrated new ways to deﬁne the meaning of words in terms\\nof vectors (Switzer, 1965), and reﬁned methods for word similarity based on mea-\\nsures of statistical association between words like mutual information (Giuliano,\\n1965) and idf (Sparck Jones, 1972), and showed that the meaning of documents\\ncould be represented in the same vector spaces used for words. Around the same\\ntime, (Cordier, 1965) showed that factor analysis of word association probabilities\\ncould be used to form dense vector representations of words.\\nSome of the philosophical underpinning of the distributional way of thinking\\ncame from the late writings of the philosopher Wittgenstein, who was skeptical of\\nthe possibility of building a completely formal theory of meaning deﬁnitions for\\neach word. Wittgenstein suggested instead that “the meaning of a word is its use in\\nthe language” (Wittgenstein, 1953, PI 43). That is, instead of using some logical lan-\\nguage to deﬁne each word, or drawing on denotations or truth values, Wittgenstein’s'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.21', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2025-08-24T11:50:50-07:00', 'source': 'data\\\\embeddings.pdf', 'file_path': 'data\\\\embeddings.pdf', 'total_pages': 27, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2025-08-24T11:50:50-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20250824115050-07'00'\", 'creationDate': \"D:20250824115050-07'00'\", 'page': 22}, page_content='HISTORICAL NOTES\\n23\\nidea is that we should deﬁne a word by how it is used by people in speaking and un-\\nderstanding in their day-to-day interactions, thus preﬁguring the movement toward\\nembodied and experiential models in linguistics and NLP (Glenberg and Robertson\\n2000, Lake and Murphy 2021, Bisk et al. 2020, Bender and Koller 2020).\\nMore distantly related is the idea of deﬁning words by a vector of discrete fea-\\ntures, which has roots at least as far back as Descartes and Leibniz (Wierzbicka 1992,\\nWierzbicka 1996). By the middle of the 20th century, beginning with the work of\\nHjelmslev (Hjelmslev, 1969) (originally 1943) and ﬂeshed out in early models of\\ngenerative grammar (Katz and Fodor, 1963), the idea arose of representing mean-\\ning with semantic features, symbols that represent some sort of primitive meaning.\\nsemantic\\nfeature\\nFor example words like hen, rooster, or chick, have something in common (they all\\ndescribe chickens) and something different (their age and sex), representable as:\\nhen\\n+female, +chicken, +adult\\nrooster -female, +chicken, +adult\\nchick\\n+chicken, -adult\\nThe dimensions used by vector models of meaning to deﬁne words, however, are\\nonly abstractly related to this idea of a small ﬁxed number of hand-built dimensions.\\nNonetheless, there has been some attempt to show that certain dimensions of em-\\nbedding models do contribute some speciﬁc compositional aspect of meaning like\\nthese early semantic features.\\nThe use of dense vectors to model word meaning, and indeed the term embed-\\nding, grew out of the latent semantic indexing (LSI) model (Deerwester et al.,\\n1988) recast as LSA (latent semantic analysis) (Deerwester et al., 1990). In LSA\\nsingular value decomposition—SVD— is applied to a term-document matrix (each\\nSVD\\ncell weighted by log frequency and normalized by entropy), and then the ﬁrst 300\\ndimensions are used as the LSA embedding. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)\\nis a method for ﬁnding the most important dimensions of a data set, those dimen-\\nsions along which the data varies the most. LSA was then quickly widely applied:\\nas a cognitive model (Landauer and Dumais, 1997), and for tasks like spell checking\\n(Jones and Martin, 1997), language modeling (Bellegarda 1997, Coccaro and Ju-\\nrafsky 1998, Bellegarda 2000), morphology induction (Schone and Jurafsky 2000,\\nSchone and Jurafsky 2001b), multiword expressions (MWEs) (Schone and Jurafsky,\\n2001a), and essay grading (Rehder et al., 1998). Related models were simultane-\\nously developed and applied to word sense disambiguation by Sch¨utze (1992). LSA\\nalso led to the earliest use of embeddings to represent words in a probabilistic clas-\\nsiﬁer, in the logistic regression document router of Sch¨utze et al. (1995). The idea of\\nSVD on the term-term matrix (rather than the term-document matrix) as a model of\\nmeaning for NLP was proposed soon after LSA by Sch¨utze (1992). Sch¨utze applied\\nthe low-rank (97-dimensional) embeddings produced by SVD to the task of word\\nsense disambiguation, analyzed the resulting semantic space, and also suggested\\npossible techniques like dropping high-order dimensions. See Sch¨utze (1997).\\nA number of alternative matrix models followed on from the early SVD work,\\nincluding Probabilistic Latent Semantic Indexing (PLSI) (Hofmann, 1999), Latent\\nDirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003), and Non-negative Matrix Factoriza-\\ntion (NMF) (Lee and Seung, 1999).\\nThe LSA community seems to have ﬁrst used the word “embedding” in Landauer\\net al. (1997), in a variant of its mathematical meaning as a mapping from one space\\nor mathematical structure to another. In LSA, the word embedding seems to have\\ndescribed the mapping from the space of sparse count vectors to the latent space of\\nSVD dense vectors. Although the word thus originally meant the mapping from one'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.21', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2025-08-24T11:50:50-07:00', 'source': 'data\\\\embeddings.pdf', 'file_path': 'data\\\\embeddings.pdf', 'total_pages': 27, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2025-08-24T11:50:50-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20250824115050-07'00'\", 'creationDate': \"D:20250824115050-07'00'\", 'page': 23}, page_content='24\\nCHAPTER 5\\n•\\nEMBEDDINGS\\nspace to another, it has metonymically shifted to mean the resulting dense vector in\\nthe latent space, and it is in this sense that we currently use the word.\\nBy the next decade, Bengio et al. (2003) and Bengio et al. (2006) showed that\\nneural language models could also be used to develop embeddings as part of the task\\nof word prediction. Collobert and Weston (2007), Collobert and Weston (2008), and\\nCollobert et al. (2011) then demonstrated that embeddings could be used to represent\\nword meanings for a number of NLP tasks. Turian et al. (2010) compared the value\\nof different kinds of embeddings for different NLP tasks. Mikolov et al. (2011)\\nshowed that recurrent neural nets could be used as language models. The idea of\\nsimplifying the hidden layer of these neural net language models to create the skip-\\ngram (and also CBOW) algorithms was proposed by Mikolov et al. (2013a).

How should\\nwe represent the meaning of a word? In the n-gram models of Chapter 3, and in\\nclassical NLP applications, our only representation of a word is as a string of letters,\\nor an index in a vocabulary list. This representation is not that different from a\\ntradition in philosophy, perhaps you’ve seen it in introductory logic classes, in which\\nthe meaning of words is represented by just spelling the word with small capital\\nletters; representing the meaning of “dog” as DOG, and “cat” as CAT, or by using an\\napostrophe (DOG’).\\nRepresenting the meaning of a word by capitalizing it is a pretty unsatisfactory\\nmodel. You might have seen a version of a joke due originally to semanticist Barbara\\nPartee (Carlson, 1977):\\nQ: What’s the meaning of life?\\nA: LIFE’\\nSurely we can do better than this! After all, we’ll want a model of word meaning\\nto do all sorts of things for us. It should tell us that some words have similar mean-\\nings (cat is similar to dog), others are antonyms (cold is the opposite of hot), some\\nhave positive connotations (happy) while others have negative connotations (sad). It\\nshould represent the fact that the meanings of buy, sell, and pay offer differing per-\\nspectives on the same underlying purchasing event. (If I buy something from you,\\nyou’ve probably sold it to me, and I likely paid you.) More generally, a model of\\nword meaning should allow us to draw inferences to address meaning-related tasks\\nlike question-answering or dialogue.\\nIn this section we summarize some of these desiderata, drawing on results in the\\nlinguistic study of word meaning, which is called lexical semantics; we’ll return to\\nlexical\\nsemantics\\nand expand on this list in Appendix G and Chapter 21.\\nLemmas and Senses\\nLet’s start by looking at how one word (we’ll choose mouse)\\nmight be deﬁned in a dictionary (simpliﬁed from the online dictionary WordNet):\\nmouse (N)\\n1.\\nany of numerous small rodents...\\n2.\\na hand-operated device that controls a cursor...\\nHere the form mouse is the lemma, also called the citation form. The form\\nlemma\\ncitation form\\nmouse would also be the lemma for the word mice; dictionaries don’t have separate\\ndeﬁnitions for inﬂected forms like mice. Similarly sing is the lemma for sing, sang,\\nsung. In many languages the inﬁnitive form is used as the lemma for the verb, so\\nSpanish dormir “to sleep” is the lemma for duermes “you sleep”. The speciﬁc forms\\nsung or carpets or sing or duermes are called wordforms.\\nwordform\\nAs the example above shows, each lemma can have multiple meanings; the\\nlemma mouse can refer to the rodent or the cursor control device. We call each\\nof these aspects of the meaning of mouse a word sense. The fact that lemmas can\\nbe polysemous (have multiple senses) can make interpretation difﬁcult (is some-\\none who searches for “mouse info” looking for a pet or a widget?). Chapter 10\\nand Appendix G will discuss the problem of polysemy, and introduce word sense\\ndisambiguation, the task of determining which sense of a word is being used in a\\nparticular context.\\nSynonymy\\nOne important component of word meaning is the relationship be-\\ntween word senses. For example when one word has a sense whose meaning is'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.21', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2025-08-24T11:50:50-07:00', 'source': './data/embeddings.pdf', 'file_path': './data/embeddings.pdf', 'total_pages': 27, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2025-08-24T11:50:50-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20250824115050-07'00'\", 'creationDate': \"D:20250824115050-07'00'\", 'page': 2}, page_content='5.1\\n•\\nLEXICAL SEMANTICS\\n3\\nidentical to a sense of another word, or nearly identical, we say the two senses of\\nthose two words are synonyms. Synonyms include such pairs as\\nsynonym\\ncouch/sofa vomit/throw up ﬁlbert/hazelnut car/automobile\\nA more formal deﬁnition of synonymy (between words rather than senses) is that\\ntwo words are synonymous if they are substitutable for one another in any sentence\\nwithout changing the truth conditions of the sentence, the situations in which the\\nsentence would be true.\\nWhile substitutions between some pairs of words like car / automobile or wa-\\nter / H2O are truth preserving, the words are still not identical in meaning. Indeed,\\nprobably no two words are absolutely identical in meaning. One of the fundamental\\ntenets of semantics, called the principle of contrast (Girard 1718, Br´eal 1897, Clark\\nprinciple of\\ncontrast\\n1987), states that a difference in linguistic form is always associated with some dif-\\nference in meaning. For example, the word H2O is used in scientiﬁc contexts and\\nwould be inappropriate in a hiking guide—water would be more appropriate— and\\nthis genre difference is part of the meaning of the word. In practice, the word syn-\\nonym is therefore used to describe a relationship of approximate or rough synonymy.\\nWord Similarity\\nWhile words don’t have many synonyms, most words do have\\nlots of similar words. Cat is not a synonym of dog, but cats and dogs are certainly\\nsimilar words. In moving from synonymy to similarity, it will be useful to shift from\\ntalking about relations between word senses (like synonymy) to relations between\\nwords (like similarity). Dealing with words avoids having to commit to a particular\\nrepresentation of word senses, which will turn out to simplify our task.\\nThe notion of word similarity is very useful in larger semantic tasks. Knowing\\nsimilarity\\nhow similar two words are can help in computing how similar the meaning of two\\nphrases or sentences are, a very important component of tasks like question answer-\\ning, paraphrasing, and summarization. One way of getting values for word similarity\\nis to ask humans to judge how similar one word is to another. A number of datasets\\nhave resulted from such experiments. For example the SimLex-999 dataset (Hill\\net al., 2015) gives values on a scale from 0 to 10, like the examples below, which\\nrange from near-synonyms (vanish, disappear) to pairs that scarcely seem to have\\nanything in common (hole, agreement):\\nvanish\\ndisappear\\n9.8\\nbelief\\nimpression 5.95\\nmuscle bone\\n3.65\\nmodest ﬂexible\\n0.98\\nhole\\nagreement\\n0.3\\nWord Relatedness\\nThe meaning of two words can be related in ways other than\\nsimilarity. One such class of connections is called word relatedness (Budanitsky\\nrelatedness\\nand Hirst, 2006), also traditionally called word association in psychology.\\nassociation\\nConsider the meanings of the words coffee and cup. Coffee is not similar to cup;\\nthey share practically no features (coffee is a plant or a beverage, while a cup is a\\nmanufactured object with a particular shape). But coffee and cup are clearly related;\\nthey are associated by co-participating in an everyday event (the event of drinking\\ncoffee out of a cup). Similarly scalpel and surgeon are not similar but are related\\neventively (a surgeon tends to make use of a scalpel).\\nOne common kind of relatedness between words is if they belong to the same\\nsemantic ﬁeld. A semantic ﬁeld is a set of words which cover a particular semantic\\nsemantic ﬁeld\\ndomain and bear structured relations with each other.

Semantic ﬁelds are also related to topic models, like Latent\\ntopic models\\nDirichlet Allocation, LDA, which apply unsupervised learning on large sets of texts\\nto induce sets of associated words from text. Semantic ﬁelds and topic models are\\nvery useful tools for discovering topical structure in documents.\\nIn Appendix G we’ll introduce more relations between senses like hypernymy\\nor IS-A, antonymy (opposites) and meronymy (part-whole relations).\\nConnotation\\nFinally, words have affective meanings or connotations. The word\\nconnotations\\nconnotation has different meanings in different ﬁelds, but here we use it to mean the\\naspects of a word’s meaning that are related to a writer or reader’s emotions, senti-\\nment, opinions, or evaluations. For example some words have positive connotations\\n(wonderful) while others have negative connotations (dreary). Even words whose\\nmeanings are similar in other ways can vary in connotation; consider the difference\\nin connotations between fake, knockoff, forgery, on the one hand, and copy, replica,\\nreproduction on the other, or innocent (positive connotation) and naive (negative\\nconnotation). Some words describe positive evaluation (great, love) and others neg-\\native evaluation (terrible, hate). Positive or negative evaluation language is called\\nsentiment, as we saw in Appendix K, and word sentiment plays a role in impor-\\nsentiment\\ntant tasks like sentiment analysis, stance detection, and applications of NLP to the\\nlanguage of politics and consumer reviews.\\nEarly work on affective meaning (Osgood et al., 1957) found that words varied\\nalong three important dimensions of affective meaning:\\nvalence: the pleasantness of the stimulus\\narousal: the intensity of emotion provoked by the stimulus\\ndominance: the degree of control exerted by the stimulus\\nThus words like happy or satisﬁed are high on valence, while unhappy or an-\\nnoyed are low on valence. Excited is high on arousal, while calm is low on arousal.\\nControlling is high on dominance, while awed or inﬂuenced are low on dominance.\\nEach word is thus represented by three numbers, corresponding to its value on each\\nof the three dimensions:\\nValence Arousal Dominance\\ncourageous 8.0\\n5.5\\n7.4\\nmusic\\n7.7\\n5.6\\n6.5\\nheartbreak\\n2.5\\n5.7\\n3.6\\ncub\\n6.7\\n4.0\\n4.2\\nOsgood et al. (1957) noticed that in using these 3 numbers to represent the\\nmeaning of a word, the model was representing each word as a point in a three-\\ndimensional space, a vector whose three dimensions corresponded to the word’s\\nrating on the three scales. This revolutionary idea that word meaning could be rep-\\nresented as a point in space (e.g., that part of the meaning of heartbreak can be\\nrepresented as the point [2.5,5.7,3.6]) was the ﬁrst expression of the vector seman-\\ntics models that we introduce next.\\n5.2\\nVector Semantics: The Intuition\\nVector semantics is the standard way to represent word meaning in NLP, helping\\nvector\\nsemantics'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.21', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2025-08-24T11:50:50-07:00', 'source': './data/embeddings.pdf', 'file_path': './data/embeddings.pdf', 'total_pages': 27, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2025-08-24T11:50:50-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20250824115050-07'00'\", 'creationDate': \"D:20250824115050-07'00'\", 'page': 4}, page_content='5.2\\n•\\nVECTOR SEMANTICS: THE INTUITION\\n5\\nus model many of the aspects of word meaning we saw in the previous section. The\\nroots of the model lie in the 1950s when two big ideas converged: Osgood’s 1957\\nidea mentioned above to use a point in three-dimensional space to represent the\\nconnotation of a word, and the proposal by linguists like Joos (1950), Harris (1954),\\nand Firth (1957) to deﬁne the meaning of a word by its distribution in language\\nuse, meaning its neighboring words or grammatical environments. Their idea was\\nthat two words that occur in very similar distributions (whose neighboring words are\\nsimilar) have similar meanings.\\nFor example, suppose you didn’t know the meaning of the word ongchoi (a re-\\ncent borrowing from Cantonese) but you see it in the following contexts:\\n(5.1) Ongchoi is delicious sauteed with garlic.\\n(5.2) Ongchoi is superb over rice.\\n(5.3) ...ongchoi leaves with salty sauces...\\nAnd suppose that you had seen many of these context words in other contexts:\\n(5.4) ...spinach sauteed with garlic over rice...\\n(5.5) ...chard stems and leaves are delicious...\\n(5.6) ...collard greens and other salty leafy greens\\nThe fact that ongchoi occurs with words like rice and garlic and delicious and\\nsalty, as do words like spinach, chard, and collard greens might suggest that ongchoi\\nis a leafy green similar to these other leafy greens.1 We can implement the same\\nintuition computationally by just counting words in the context of ongchoi.\\nFigure 5.1\\nA two-dimensional (t-SNE) visualization of 200-dimensional word2vec em-\\nbeddings for some words close to the word sweet, showing that words with similar mean-\\nings are nearby in space.

Vectors for representing words are called embeddings.\\nembeddings\\nThe word “embedding” derives historically from its mathematical sense as a map-\\nping from one space or structure to another, although the meaning has shifted; see\\nthe end of the chapter.\\nFig. 5.1 shows a visualization of embeddings learned by the word2vec algorithm,\\nshowing the location of selected words (neighbors of “sweet”) projected down from\\n1\\nIt’s in fact Ipomoea aquatica, a relative of morning glory sometimes called water spinach in English.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.21', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2025-08-24T11:50:50-07:00', 'source': './data/embeddings.pdf', 'file_path': './data/embeddings.pdf', 'total_pages': 27, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2025-08-24T11:50:50-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20250824115050-07'00'\", 'creationDate': \"D:20250824115050-07'00'\", 'page': 5}, page_content='6\\nCHAPTER 5\\n•\\nEMBEDDINGS\\n200-dimensional space into a 2-dimensional space. Note that the nearest neighbors\\nof sweet are semantically related words like honey, candy, juice, chocolate. This idea\\nthat similar words are near each other in high-dimensional space is an important\\nthat offers enormous power to language models and other NLP applications. For\\nexample the sentiment classiﬁers of Chapter 4 depend on the same words appearing\\nin the training and test sets. But by representing words as embeddings, a classiﬁer\\ncan assign sentiment as long as it sees some words with similar meanings. And as\\nwe’ll see, vector semantic models like the ones showed in Fig. 5.1 can be learned\\nautomatically from text without supervision.\\nIn this chapter we’ll begin with a simple pedagogical model of embeddings in\\nwhich the meaning of a word is deﬁned by a vector with the counts of nearby words.\\nWe introduce this model as a helpful way to understand the concept of vectors and\\nwhat it means for a vector to be a representation of word meaning, but more sophis-\\nticated variants like the tf-idf model we will introduce in Chapter 11 are important\\nmethods you should understand. We will see that this method results in very long\\nvectors that are sparse, i.e. mostly zeros (since most words simply never occur in the\\ncontext of others). We’ll then introduce the word2vec model family for constructing\\nshort, dense vectors that have even more useful semantic properties.\\nWe’ll also introduce the cosine, the standard way to use embeddings to com-\\npute semantic similarity, between two words, two sentences, or two documents, an\\nimportant tool in practical applications.\\n5.3\\nSimple count-based embeddings\\n“The most important attributes of a vector in 3-space are {Location, Location, Location}”\\nRandall Munroe, the hover from https://xkcd.com/2358/\\nLet’s now introduce the ﬁrst way to compute word vector embeddings. This sim-\\nplest vector model of meaning is based on the co-occurrence matrix, a way of rep-\\nresenting how often words co-occur. We’ll deﬁne a particular kind of co-occurrence\\nmatrix, the word-context matrix, in which each row in the matrix represents a word\\nword-context\\nmatrix\\nin the vocabulary and each column represents how often each other word in the vo-\\ncabulary appears nearby.

To review some basic linear\\nalgebra, a vector is, at heart, just a list or array of numbers. So cherry is represented\\nvector\\nas the list [1,0,1] (the ﬁrst row vector in Fig. 5.2) and information is represented as\\nthe list [1,1,0] (the fourth row vector).\\nA vector space is a collection of vectors, and is characterized by its dimension.\\nvector space\\ndimension\\nVectors in a 3-dimensional vector space have an element for each dimension of the\\nspace.

The raw dot product\\nthus will be higher for frequent words. But this is a problem; we’d like a similarity\\nmetric that tells us how similar two words are regardless of their frequency.\\nWe modify the dot product to normalize for the vector length by dividing the\\ndot product by the lengths of each of the two vectors. This normalized dot product\\nturns out to be the same as the cosine of the angle between the two vectors, following\\nfrom the deﬁnition of the dot product between two vectors a and b:\\na·b = |a||b|cosθ\\na·b\\n|a||b| = cosθ\\n(5.9)\\nThe cosine similarity metric between two vectors v and w thus can be computed as:\\ncosine\\ncosine(v,w) = v ·w\\n|v||w| =\\nN\\nX\\ni=1\\nviwi\\nv\\nu\\nu\\nt\\nN\\nX\\ni=1\\nv2\\ni\\nv\\nu\\nu\\nt\\nN\\nX\\ni=1\\nw2\\ni\\n(5.10)\\nFor some applications we pre-normalize each vector, by dividing it by its length,\\ncreating a unit vector of length 1.

We now introduce a more\\npowerful word representation: embeddings, short dense vectors. Unlike the vectors\\nwe’ve seen so far, embeddings are short, with number of dimensions d ranging from\\n50-1000, rather than the much larger vocabulary size |V|.These d dimensions don’t\\nhave a clear interpretation. And the vectors are dense: instead of vector entries\\nbeing sparse, mostly-zero counts or functions of counts, the values will be real-\\nvalued numbers that can be negative.\\nIt turns out that dense vectors work better in every NLP task than sparse vectors.\\nWhile we don’t completely understand all the reasons for this, we have some intu-\\nitions. Representing words as 300-dimensional dense vectors requires our classiﬁers\\nto learn far fewer weights than if we represented words as 50,000-dimensional vec-\\ntors, and the smaller parameter space possibly helps with generalization and avoid-\\ning overﬁtting. Dense vectors may also do a better job of capturing synonymy.\\nFor example, in a sparse vector representation, dimensions for synonyms like car\\nand automobile dimension are distinct and unrelated; sparse vectors may thus fail\\nto capture the similarity between a word with car as a neighbor and a word with\\nautomobile as a neighbor.\\nIn this section we introduce one method for computing embeddings: skip-gram\\nskip-gram\\nwith negative sampling, sometimes called SGNS. The skip-gram algorithm is one\\nSGNS\\nof two algorithms in a software package called word2vec, and so sometimes the\\nword2vec\\nalgorithm is loosely referred to as word2vec (Mikolov et al. 2013a, Mikolov et al.\\n2013b).

In Chapter 10 we’ll introduce methods for learning dynamic contextual\\nembeddings like the popular family of BERT representations, in which the vector\\nfor each word is different in different contexts.\\nThe intuition of word2vec is that instead of counting how often each word w oc-\\ncurs near, say, apricot, we’ll instead train a classiﬁer on a binary prediction task: “Is\\nword w likely to show up near apricot?” We don’t actually care about this prediction\\ntask; instead we’ll take the learned classiﬁer weights as the word embeddings.\\nThe revolutionary intuition here is that we can just use running text as implicitly\\nsupervised training data for such a classiﬁer; a word c that occurs near the target\\nword apricot acts as gold ‘correct answer’ to the question “Is word c likely to show\\nup near apricot?” This method, often called self-supervision, avoids the need for\\nself-supervision\\nany sort of hand-labeled supervision signal. This idea was ﬁrst proposed in the task\\nof neural language modeling, when Bengio et al. (2003) and Collobert et al. (2011)\\nshowed that a neural language model (a neural network that learned to predict the\\nnext word from prior words) could just use the next word in running text as its\\nsupervision signal, and could be used to learn an embedding representation for each\\nword as part of doing this prediction task.\\nWe’ll see how to do neural networks in the next chapter, but word2vec is a\\nmuch simpler model than the neural network language model, in two ways. First,\\nword2vec simpliﬁes the task (making it binary classiﬁcation instead of word pre-\\ndiction). Second, word2vec simpliﬁes the architecture (training a logistic regression\\nclassiﬁer instead of a multi-layer neural network with hidden layers that demand\\nmore sophisticated training algorithms). The intuition of skip-gram is:\\n1. Treat the target word and a neighboring context word as positive examples.\\n2. Randomly sample other words in the lexicon to get negative samples.\\n3.

An extension of word2vec, fasttext\\nfasttext\\n(Bojanowski et al., 2017), addresses a problem with word2vec as we have presented\\nit so far: it has no good way to deal with unknown words—words that appear in\\na test corpus but were unseen in the training corpus. A related problem is word\\nsparsity, such as in languages with rich morphology, where some of the many forms\\nfor each noun and verb may only occur rarely. Fasttext deals with these problems\\nby using subword models, representing each word as itself plus a bag of constituent\\nn-grams, with special boundary symbols < and > added to each word. For example,\\nwith n = 3 the word where would be represented by the sequence <where> plus the\\ncharacter n-grams:\\n<wh, whe, her, ere, re>\\nThen a skipgram embedding is learned for each constituent n-gram, and the word\\nwhere is represented by the sum of all of the embeddings of its constituent n-grams.\\nUnknown words can then be presented only by the sum of the constituent n-grams.\\nA fasttext open-source library, including pretrained embeddings for 157 languages,\\nis available at https://fasttext.cc.\\nAnother very widely used static embedding model is GloVe (Pennington et al.,\\n2014), short for Global Vectors, because the model is based on capturing global\\ncorpus statistics. GloVe is based on ratios of probabilities from the word-word co-\\noccurrence matrix.\\nIt turns out that dense embeddings like word2vec actually have an elegant math-\\nematical relationship with count-based embeddings, in which word2vec can be seen\\nas implicitly optimizing a function of a count matrix with a particular (PPMI) weight-\\ning (Levy and Goldberg, 2014c).\\n5.6\\nVisualizing Embeddings\\n“I see well in many dimensions as long as the dimensions are around two.”\\nThe late economist Martin Shubik\\nVisualizing embeddings is an important goal in helping understand, apply, and\\nimprove these models of word meaning.

For example the 7 closest\\nwords to frog using a particular embeddings computed with\\nthe GloVe algorithm are: frogs, toad, litoria, leptodactyli-\\ndae, rana, lizard, and eleutherodactylus (Pennington et al.,\\n2014).\\nYet another visualization method is to use a clustering\\nalgorithm to show a hierarchical representation of which\\nwords are similar to others in the embedding space.

Fig. 5.1 showed one such visualization, as does\\nFig. 5.9, using a projection method called t-SNE (van der\\nMaaten and Hinton, 2008).\\n5.7\\nSemantic properties of embeddings\\nIn this section we brieﬂy summarize some of the semantic properties of embeddings\\nthat have been studied.\\nDifferent types of similarity or association:\\nOne parameter of vector semantic\\nmodels that is relevant to both sparse PPMI vectors and dense word2vec vectors is\\nthe size of the context window used to collect counts. This is generally between 1\\nand 10 words on each side of the target word (for a total context of 2-20 words).\\nThe choice depends on the goals of the representation. Shorter context windows\\ntend to lead to representations that are a bit more syntactic, since the information is\\ncoming from immediately nearby words. When the vectors are computed from short\\ncontext windows, the most similar words to a target word w tend to be semantically\\nsimilar words with the same parts of speech. When vectors are computed from long\\ncontext windows, the highest cosine words to a target word w tend to be words that\\nare topically related but not similar.\\nFor example Levy and Goldberg (2014a) showed that using skip-gram with a\\nwindow of ±2, the most similar words to the word Hogwarts (from the Harry Potter\\nseries) were names of other ﬁctional schools: Sunnydale (from Buffy the Vampire\\nSlayer) or Evernight (from a vampire series). With a window of ±5, the most similar\\nwords to Hogwarts were other words topically related to the Harry Potter series:\\nDumbledore, Malfoy, and half-blood.\\nIt’s also often useful to distinguish two kinds of similarity or association between\\nwords (Sch¨utze and Pedersen, 1993). Two words have ﬁrst-order co-occurrence\\nﬁrst-order\\nco-occurrence\\n(sometimes called syntagmatic association) if they are typically nearby each other.\\nThus wrote is a ﬁrst-order associate of book or poem. Two words have second-order\\nco-occurrence (sometimes called paradigmatic association) if they have similar\\nsecond-order\\nco-occurrence\\nneighbors. Thus wrote is a second-order associate of words like said or remarked.\\nAnalogy/Relational Similarity:\\nAnother semantic property of embeddings is their\\nability to capture relational meanings. In an important early vector space model of\\ncognition, Rumelhart and Abrahamson (1973) proposed the parallelogram model\\nparallelogram\\nmodel\\nfor solving simple analogy problems of the form a is to b as a* is to what?. In such\\nproblems, a system is given a problem like apple:tree::grape:?, i.e., apple is to tree\\nas grape is to\\n, and must ﬁll in the word vine. In the parallelogram model, il-\\nlustrated in Fig. 5.8, the vector from the word apple to the word tree (= #   »\\ntree−#       »\\napple)\\nis added to the vector for grape (#        »\\ngrape); the nearest word to that point is returned.\\nIn early work with sparse embeddings, scholars showed that sparse vector mod-\\nels of meaning could solve such analogy problems (Turney and Littman, 2005),\\nbut the parallelogram method received more modern attention because of its suc-\\ncess with word2vec or GloVe vectors (Mikolov et al. 2013c, Levy and Goldberg\\n2014b, Pennington et al. 2014). For example, the result of the expression #     »\\nking −\\n#     »\\nman + #            »\\nwoman is a vector close to #         »\\nqueen. Similarly, #      »\\nParis −#           »\\nFrance + #     »\\nItaly results\\nin a vector that is close to #         »\\nRome.

For example Fig. 5.10 shows a visualization of changes in meaning in\\nEnglish words over the last two centuries, computed by building separate embedding\\nspaces for each decade from historical corpora like Google n-grams (Lin et al., 2012)\\nand the Corpus of Historical American English (Davies, 2012).\\nFigure 5.10\\nA t-SNE visualization of the semantic change of 3 words in English using\\nword2vec vectors. The modern sense of each word, and the grey context words, are com-\\nputed from the most recent (modern) time-point embedding space. Earlier points are com-\\nputed from earlier historical embedding spaces. The visualizations show the changes in the\\nword gay from meanings related to “cheerful” or “frolicsome” to referring to homosexuality,\\nthe development of the modern “transmission” sense of broadcast from its original sense of\\nsowing seeds, and the pejoration of the word awful as it shifted from meaning “full of awe”\\nto meaning “terrible or appalling” (Hamilton et al., 2016).\\n5.8\\nBias and Embeddings\\nIn addition to their ability to learn word meaning from text, embeddings, alas,\\nalso reproduce the implicit biases and stereotypes that were latent in the text. As\\nthe prior section just showed, embeddings can roughly model relational similar-\\nity: ‘queen’ as the closest word to ‘king’ - ‘man’ + ‘woman’ implies the analogy\\nman:woman::king:queen. But these same embedding analogies also exhibit gender\\nstereotypes. For example Bolukbasi et al. (2016) ﬁnd that the closest occupation\\nto ‘computer programmer’ - ‘man’ + ‘woman’ in word2vec embeddings trained on\\nnews text is ‘homemaker’, and that the embeddings similarly suggest the analogy\\n‘father’ is to ‘doctor’ as ‘mother’ is to ‘nurse’. This could result in what Crawford\\n(2017) and Blodgett et al. (2020) call an allocational harm, when a system allo-\\nallocational\\nharm\\ncates resources (jobs or credit) unfairly to different groups. For example algorithms\\nthat use embeddings as part of a search for hiring potential programmers or doctors\\nmight thus incorrectly downweight documents with women’s names.\\nIt turns out that embeddings don’t just reﬂect the statistics of their input, but also\\namplify bias; gendered terms become more gendered in embedding space than they\\nbias\\nampliﬁcation\\nwere in the input text statistics (Zhao et al. 2017, Ethayarajh et al. 2019b, Jia et al.\\n2020), and biases are more exaggerated than in actual labor employment statistics\\n(Garg et al., 2018).\\nEmbeddings also encode the implicit associations that are a property of human\\nreasoning.

Caliskan\\net al. (2017) replicated all these ﬁndings of implicit associations using GloVe vectors\\nand cosine similarity instead of human latencies. For example African-American\\nnames like ‘Leroy’ and ‘Shaniqua’ had a higher GloVe cosine with unpleasant words\\nwhile European-American names (‘Brad’, ‘Greg’, ‘Courtney’) had a higher cosine\\nwith pleasant words. These problems with embeddings are an example of a repre-\\nsentational harm (Crawford 2017, Blodgett et al. 2020), which is a harm caused by\\nrepresentational\\nharm\\na system demeaning or even ignoring some social groups. Any embedding-aware al-\\ngorithm that made use of word sentiment could thus exacerbate bias against African\\nAmericans.\\nRecent research focuses on ways to try to remove these kinds of biases, for\\nexample by developing a transformation of the embedding space that removes gen-\\nder stereotypes but preserves deﬁnitional gender (Bolukbasi et al. 2016, Zhao et al.\\n2017) or changing the training procedure (Zhao et al., 2018). However, although\\nthese sorts of debiasing may reduce bias in embeddings, they do not eliminate it\\ndebiasing\\n(Gonen and Goldberg, 2019), and this remains an open problem.\\nHistorical embeddings are also being used to measure biases in the past. Garg\\net al. (2018) used embeddings from historical texts to measure the association be-\\ntween embeddings for occupations and embeddings for names of various ethnici-\\nties or genders (for example the relative cosine similarity of women’s names versus\\nmen’s to occupation words like ‘librarian’ or ‘carpenter’) across the 20th century.\\nThey found that the cosines correlate with the empirical historical percentages of\\nwomen or ethnic groups in those occupations. Historical embeddings also repli-\\ncated old surveys of ethnic stereotypes; the tendency of experimental participants in\\n1933 to associate adjectives like ‘industrious’ or ‘superstitious’ with, e.g., Chinese\\nethnicity, correlates with the cosine between Chinese last names and those adjectives\\nusing embeddings trained on 1930s text. They also were able to document historical\\ngender biases, such as the fact that embeddings for adjectives related to competence\\n(‘smart’, ‘wise’, ‘thoughtful’, ‘resourceful’) had a higher cosine with male than fe-\\nmale words, and showed that this bias has been slowly decreasing since 1960. We\\nreturn in later chapters to this question about the role of bias in natural language\\nprocessing.\\n5.9\\nEvaluating Vector Models\\nThe most important evaluation metric for vector models is extrinsic evaluation on\\ntasks, i.e., using vectors in an NLP task and seeing whether this improves perfor-\\nmance over some other model.\\n3\\nRoughly speaking, if humans associate ‘ﬂowers’ with ‘pleasantness’ and ‘insects’ with ‘unpleasant-\\nness’, when they are instructed to push a green button for ‘ﬂowers’ (daisy, iris, lilac) and ‘pleasant words’\\n(love, laughter, pleasure) and a red button for ‘insects’ (ﬂea, spider, mosquito) and ‘unpleasant words’\\n(abuse, hatred, ugly) they are faster than in an incongruous condition where they push a red button for\\n‘ﬂowers’ and ‘unpleasant words’ and a green button for ‘insects’ and ‘pleasant words’.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.21', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2025-08-24T11:50:50-07:00', 'source': './data/embeddings.pdf', 'file_path': './data/embeddings.pdf', 'total_pages': 27, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2025-08-24T11:50:50-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20250824115050-07'00'\", 'creationDate': \"D:20250824115050-07'00'\", 'page': 20}, page_content='5.10\\n•\\nSUMMARY\\n21\\nNonetheless it is useful to have intrinsic evaluations. The most common metric\\nis to test their performance on similarity, computing the correlation between an\\nalgorithm’s word similarity scores and word similarity ratings assigned by humans.\\nWordSim-353 (Finkelstein et al., 2002) is a commonly used set of ratings from 0\\nto 10 for 353 noun pairs; for example (plane, car) had an average score of 5.77.\\nSimLex-999 (Hill et al., 2015) is a more complex dataset that quantiﬁes similarity\\n(cup, mug) rather than relatedness (cup, coffee), and includes concrete and abstract\\nadjective, noun and verb pairs. The TOEFL dataset is a set of 80 questions, each\\nconsisting of a target word with 4 additional word choices; the task is to choose\\nwhich is the correct synonym, as in the example: Levied is closest in meaning to:\\nimposed, believed, requested, correlated (Landauer and Dumais, 1997). All of these\\ndatasets present words without context.\\nSlightly more realistic are intrinsic similarity tasks that include context. The\\nStanford Contextual Word Similarity (SCWS) dataset (Huang et al., 2012) and the\\nWord-in-Context (WiC) dataset (Pilehvar and Camacho-Collados, 2019) offer richer\\nevaluation scenarios. SCWS gives human judgments on 2,003 pairs of words in\\ntheir sentential context, while WiC gives target words in two sentential contexts that\\nare either in the same or different senses; see Appendix G. The semantic textual\\nsimilarity task (Agirre et al. 2012, Agirre et al. 2015) evaluates the performance of\\nsentence-level similarity algorithms, consisting of a set of pairs of sentences, each\\npair with human-labeled similarity scores.\\nAnother task used for evaluation is the analogy task, discussed on page 17, where\\nthe system has to solve problems of the form a is to b as a* is to b*, given a, b, and a*\\nand having to ﬁnd b* (Turney and Littman, 2005). A number of sets of tuples have\\nbeen created for this task (Mikolov et al. 2013a, Mikolov et al. 2013c, Gladkova\\net al. 2016), covering morphology (city:cities::child:children), lexicographic rela-\\ntions (leg:table::spout:teapot) and encyclopedia relations (Beijing:China::Dublin:Ireland),\\nsome drawing from the SemEval-2012 Task 2 dataset of 79 different relations (Jur-\\ngens et al., 2012).\\nAll embedding algorithms suffer from inherent variability. For example because\\nof randomness in the initialization and the random negative sampling, algorithms\\nlike word2vec may produce different results even from the same dataset, and in-\\ndividual documents in a collection may strongly impact the resulting embeddings\\n(Tian et al. 2016, Hellrich and Hahn 2016, Antoniak and Mimno 2018). When em-\\nbeddings are used to study word associations in particular corpora, therefore, it is\\nbest practice to train multiple embeddings with bootstrap sampling over documents\\nand average the results (Antoniak and Mimno, 2018).\\n5.10\\nSummary\\n• In vector semantics, a word is modeled as a vector—a point in high-dimensional\\nspace, also called an embedding. In this chapter we focus on static embed-\\ndings, where each word is mapped to a ﬁxed embedding.\\n• Vector semantic models fall into two classes: sparse and dense. In sparse\\nmodels each dimension corresponds to a word in the vocabulary V and cells\\nare functions of co-occurrence counts. The word-context or term-term ma-\\ntrix has a row for each (target) word in the vocabulary and a column for each\\ncontext term in the vocabulary.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.21', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2025-08-24T11:50:50-07:00', 'source': './data/embeddings.pdf', 'file_path': './data/embeddings.pdf', 'total_pages': 27, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2025-08-24T11:50:50-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20250824115050-07'00'\", 'creationDate': \"D:20250824115050-07'00'\", 'page': 21}, page_content='22\\nCHAPTER 5\\n•\\nEMBEDDINGS\\n• Dense vector models typically have dimensionality 50–1000. Word2vec al-\\ngorithms like skip-gram are a popular way to compute dense embeddings.\\nSkip-gram trains a logistic regression classiﬁer to compute the probability that\\ntwo words are ‘likely to occur nearby in text’. This probability is computed\\nfrom the dot product between the embeddings for the two words.\\n• Skip-gram uses stochastic gradient descent to train the classiﬁer, by learning\\nembeddings that have a high dot product with embeddings of words that occur\\nnearby and a low dot product with noise words.\\n• Other important embedding algorithms include GloVe, a method based on\\nratios of word co-occurrence probabilities.\\n• Whether using sparse or dense vectors, word and document similarities are\\ncomputed by some function of the dot product between vectors. The cosine\\nof two vectors—a normalized dot product—is the most popular such metric.\\nHistorical Notes\\nThe idea of vector semantics arose out of research in the 1950s in three distinct\\nﬁelds: linguistics, psychology, and computer science, each of which contributed a\\nfundamental aspect of the model.\\nThe idea that meaning is related to the distribution of words in context was\\nwidespread in linguistic theory of the 1950s, among distributionalists like Zellig\\nHarris, Martin Joos, and J. R. Firth, and semioticians like Thomas Sebeok. As Joos\\n(1950) put it,\\nthe linguist’s “meaning” of a morpheme. . . is by deﬁnition the set of conditional\\nprobabilities of its occurrence in context with all other morphemes.\\nThe idea that the meaning of a word might be modeled as a point in a multi-\\ndimensional semantic space came from psychologists like Charles E. Osgood, who\\nhad been studying how people responded to the meaning of words by assigning val-\\nues along scales like happy/sad or hard/soft. Osgood et al. (1957) proposed that the\\nmeaning of a word in general could be modeled as a point in a multidimensional\\nEuclidean space, and that the similarity of meaning between two words could be\\nmodeled as the distance between these points in the space.\\nA ﬁnal intellectual source in the 1950s and early 1960s was the ﬁeld then called\\nmechanical indexing, now known as information retrieval. In what became known\\nmechanical\\nindexing\\nas the vector space model for information retrieval (Salton 1971, Sparck Jones\\n1986), researchers demonstrated new ways to deﬁne the meaning of words in terms\\nof vectors (Switzer, 1965), and reﬁned methods for word similarity based on mea-\\nsures of statistical association between words like mutual information (Giuliano,\\n1965) and idf (Sparck Jones, 1972), and showed that the meaning of documents\\ncould be represented in the same vector spaces used for words. Around the same\\ntime, (Cordier, 1965) showed that factor analysis of word association probabilities\\ncould be used to form dense vector representations of words.\\nSome of the philosophical underpinning of the distributional way of thinking\\ncame from the late writings of the philosopher Wittgenstein, who was skeptical of\\nthe possibility of building a completely formal theory of meaning deﬁnitions for\\neach word. Wittgenstein suggested instead that “the meaning of a word is its use in\\nthe language” (Wittgenstein, 1953, PI 43). That is, instead of using some logical lan-\\nguage to deﬁne each word, or drawing on denotations or truth values, Wittgenstein’s'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.21', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2025-08-24T11:50:50-07:00', 'source': './data/embeddings.pdf', 'file_path': './data/embeddings.pdf', 'total_pages': 27, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2025-08-24T11:50:50-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20250824115050-07'00'\", 'creationDate': \"D:20250824115050-07'00'\", 'page': 22}, page_content='HISTORICAL NOTES\\n23\\nidea is that we should deﬁne a word by how it is used by people in speaking and un-\\nderstanding in their day-to-day interactions, thus preﬁguring the movement toward\\nembodied and experiential models in linguistics and NLP (Glenberg and Robertson\\n2000, Lake and Murphy 2021, Bisk et al. 2020, Bender and Koller 2020).\\nMore distantly related is the idea of deﬁning words by a vector of discrete fea-\\ntures, which has roots at least as far back as Descartes and Leibniz (Wierzbicka 1992,\\nWierzbicka 1996). By the middle of the 20th century, beginning with the work of\\nHjelmslev (Hjelmslev, 1969) (originally 1943) and ﬂeshed out in early models of\\ngenerative grammar (Katz and Fodor, 1963), the idea arose of representing mean-\\ning with semantic features, symbols that represent some sort of primitive meaning.\\nsemantic\\nfeature\\nFor example words like hen, rooster, or chick, have something in common (they all\\ndescribe chickens) and something different (their age and sex), representable as:\\nhen\\n+female, +chicken, +adult\\nrooster -female, +chicken, +adult\\nchick\\n+chicken, -adult\\nThe dimensions used by vector models of meaning to deﬁne words, however, are\\nonly abstractly related to this idea of a small ﬁxed number of hand-built dimensions.\\nNonetheless, there has been some attempt to show that certain dimensions of em-\\nbedding models do contribute some speciﬁc compositional aspect of meaning like\\nthese early semantic features.\\nThe use of dense vectors to model word meaning, and indeed the term embed-\\nding, grew out of the latent semantic indexing (LSI) model (Deerwester et al.,\\n1988) recast as LSA (latent semantic analysis) (Deerwester et al., 1990). In LSA\\nsingular value decomposition—SVD— is applied to a term-document matrix (each\\nSVD\\ncell weighted by log frequency and normalized by entropy), and then the ﬁrst 300\\ndimensions are used as the LSA embedding. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)\\nis a method for ﬁnding the most important dimensions of a data set, those dimen-\\nsions along which the data varies the most. LSA was then quickly widely applied:\\nas a cognitive model (Landauer and Dumais, 1997), and for tasks like spell checking\\n(Jones and Martin, 1997), language modeling (Bellegarda 1997, Coccaro and Ju-\\nrafsky 1998, Bellegarda 2000), morphology induction (Schone and Jurafsky 2000,\\nSchone and Jurafsky 2001b), multiword expressions (MWEs) (Schone and Jurafsky,\\n2001a), and essay grading (Rehder et al., 1998). Related models were simultane-\\nously developed and applied to word sense disambiguation by Sch¨utze (1992). LSA\\nalso led to the earliest use of embeddings to represent words in a probabilistic clas-\\nsiﬁer, in the logistic regression document router of Sch¨utze et al. (1995). The idea of\\nSVD on the term-term matrix (rather than the term-document matrix) as a model of\\nmeaning for NLP was proposed soon after LSA by Sch¨utze (1992). Sch¨utze applied\\nthe low-rank (97-dimensional) embeddings produced by SVD to the task of word\\nsense disambiguation, analyzed the resulting semantic space, and also suggested\\npossible techniques like dropping high-order dimensions. See Sch¨utze (1997).\\nA number of alternative matrix models followed on from the early SVD work,\\nincluding Probabilistic Latent Semantic Indexing (PLSI) (Hofmann, 1999), Latent\\nDirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003), and Non-negative Matrix Factoriza-\\ntion (NMF) (Lee and Seung, 1999).\\nThe LSA community seems to have ﬁrst used the word “embedding” in Landauer\\net al. (1997), in a variant of its mathematical meaning as a mapping from one space\\nor mathematical structure to another. In LSA, the word embedding seems to have\\ndescribed the mapping from the space of sparse count vectors to the latent space of\\nSVD dense vectors. Although the word thus originally meant the mapping from one'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.21', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2025-08-24T11:50:50-07:00', 'source': './data/embeddings.pdf', 'file_path': './data/embeddings.pdf', 'total_pages': 27, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2025-08-24T11:50:50-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20250824115050-07'00'\", 'creationDate': \"D:20250824115050-07'00'\", 'page': 23}, page_content='24\\nCHAPTER 5\\n•\\nEMBEDDINGS\\nspace to another, it has metonymically shifted to mean the resulting dense vector in\\nthe latent space, and it is in this sense that we currently use the word.\\nBy the next decade, Bengio et al. (2003) and Bengio et al. (2006) showed that\\nneural language models could also be used to develop embeddings as part of the task\\nof word prediction. Collobert and Weston (2007), Collobert and Weston (2008), and\\nCollobert et al. (2011) then demonstrated that embeddings could be used to represent\\nword meanings for a number of NLP tasks. Turian et al. (2010) compared the value\\nof different kinds of embeddings for different NLP tasks. Mikolov et al. (2011)\\nshowed that recurrent neural nets could be used as language models. The idea of\\nsimplifying the hidden layer of these neural net language models to create the skip-\\ngram (and also CBOW) algorithms was proposed by Mikolov et al. (2013a).

How should\\nwe represent the meaning of a word? In the n-gram models of Chapter 3, and in\\nclassical NLP applications, our only representation of a word is as a string of letters,\\nor an index in a vocabulary list. This representation is not that different from a\\ntradition in philosophy, perhaps you’ve seen it in introductory logic classes, in which\\nthe meaning of words is represented by just spelling the word with small capital\\nletters; representing the meaning of “dog” as DOG, and “cat” as CAT, or by using an\\napostrophe (DOG’).\\nRepresenting the meaning of a word by capitalizing it is a pretty unsatisfactory\\nmodel. You might have seen a version of a joke due originally to semanticist Barbara\\nPartee (Carlson, 1977):\\nQ: What’s the meaning of life?\\nA: LIFE’\\nSurely we can do better than this! After all, we’ll want a model of word meaning\\nto do all sorts of things for us. It should tell us that some words have similar mean-\\nings (cat is similar to dog), others are antonyms (cold is the opposite of hot), some\\nhave positive connotations (happy) while others have negative connotations (sad). It\\nshould represent the fact that the meanings of buy, sell, and pay offer differing per-\\nspectives on the same underlying purchasing event. (If I buy something from you,\\nyou’ve probably sold it to me, and I likely paid you.) More generally, a model of\\nword meaning should allow us to draw inferences to address meaning-related tasks\\nlike question-answering or dialogue.\\nIn this section we summarize some of these desiderata, drawing on results in the\\nlinguistic study of word meaning, which is called lexical semantics; we’ll return to\\nlexical\\nsemantics\\nand expand on this list in Appendix G and Chapter 21.\\nLemmas and Senses\\nLet’s start by looking at how one word (we’ll choose mouse)\\nmight be deﬁned in a dictionary (simpliﬁed from the online dictionary WordNet):\\nmouse (N)\\n1.\\nany of numerous small rodents...\\n2.\\na hand-operated device that controls a cursor...\\nHere the form mouse is the lemma, also called the citation form. The form\\nlemma\\ncitation form\\nmouse would also be the lemma for the word mice; dictionaries don’t have separate\\ndeﬁnitions for inﬂected forms like mice. Similarly sing is the lemma for sing, sang,\\nsung. In many languages the inﬁnitive form is used as the lemma for the verb, so\\nSpanish dormir “to sleep” is the lemma for duermes “you sleep”. The speciﬁc forms\\nsung or carpets or sing or duermes are called wordforms.\\nwordform\\nAs the example above shows, each lemma can have multiple meanings; the\\nlemma mouse can refer to the rodent or the cursor control device. We call each\\nof these aspects of the meaning of mouse a word sense. The fact that lemmas can\\nbe polysemous (have multiple senses) can make interpretation difﬁcult (is some-\\none who searches for “mouse info” looking for a pet or a widget?). Chapter 10\\nand Appendix G will discuss the problem of polysemy, and introduce word sense\\ndisambiguation, the task of determining which sense of a word is being used in a\\nparticular context.\\nSynonymy\\nOne important component of word meaning is the relationship be-\\ntween word senses. For example when one word has a sense whose meaning is'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.21', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2025-08-24T11:50:50-07:00', 'source': 'embeddings.pdf', 'file_path': 'data\\\\embeddings.pdf', 'total_pages': 27, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2025-08-24T11:50:50-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20250824115050-07'00'\", 'creationDate': \"D:20250824115050-07'00'\", 'page': 2}, page_content='5.1\\n•\\nLEXICAL SEMANTICS\\n3\\nidentical to a sense of another word, or nearly identical, we say the two senses of\\nthose two words are synonyms. Synonyms include such pairs as\\nsynonym\\ncouch/sofa vomit/throw up ﬁlbert/hazelnut car/automobile\\nA more formal deﬁnition of synonymy (between words rather than senses) is that\\ntwo words are synonymous if they are substitutable for one another in any sentence\\nwithout changing the truth conditions of the sentence, the situations in which the\\nsentence would be true.\\nWhile substitutions between some pairs of words like car / automobile or wa-\\nter / H2O are truth preserving, the words are still not identical in meaning. Indeed,\\nprobably no two words are absolutely identical in meaning. One of the fundamental\\ntenets of semantics, called the principle of contrast (Girard 1718, Br´eal 1897, Clark\\nprinciple of\\ncontrast\\n1987), states that a difference in linguistic form is always associated with some dif-\\nference in meaning. For example, the word H2O is used in scientiﬁc contexts and\\nwould be inappropriate in a hiking guide—water would be more appropriate— and\\nthis genre difference is part of the meaning of the word. In practice, the word syn-\\nonym is therefore used to describe a relationship of approximate or rough synonymy.\\nWord Similarity\\nWhile words don’t have many synonyms, most words do have\\nlots of similar words. Cat is not a synonym of dog, but cats and dogs are certainly\\nsimilar words. In moving from synonymy to similarity, it will be useful to shift from\\ntalking about relations between word senses (like synonymy) to relations between\\nwords (like similarity). Dealing with words avoids having to commit to a particular\\nrepresentation of word senses, which will turn out to simplify our task.\\nThe notion of word similarity is very useful in larger semantic tasks. Knowing\\nsimilarity\\nhow similar two words are can help in computing how similar the meaning of two\\nphrases or sentences are, a very important component of tasks like question answer-\\ning, paraphrasing, and summarization. One way of getting values for word similarity\\nis to ask humans to judge how similar one word is to another. A number of datasets\\nhave resulted from such experiments. For example the SimLex-999 dataset (Hill\\net al., 2015) gives values on a scale from 0 to 10, like the examples below, which\\nrange from near-synonyms (vanish, disappear) to pairs that scarcely seem to have\\nanything in common (hole, agreement):\\nvanish\\ndisappear\\n9.8\\nbelief\\nimpression 5.95\\nmuscle bone\\n3.65\\nmodest ﬂexible\\n0.98\\nhole\\nagreement\\n0.3\\nWord Relatedness\\nThe meaning of two words can be related in ways other than\\nsimilarity. One such class of connections is called word relatedness (Budanitsky\\nrelatedness\\nand Hirst, 2006), also traditionally called word association in psychology.\\nassociation\\nConsider the meanings of the words coffee and cup. Coffee is not similar to cup;\\nthey share practically no features (coffee is a plant or a beverage, while a cup is a\\nmanufactured object with a particular shape). But coffee and cup are clearly related;\\nthey are associated by co-participating in an everyday event (the event of drinking\\ncoffee out of a cup). Similarly scalpel and surgeon are not similar but are related\\neventively (a surgeon tends to make use of a scalpel).\\nOne common kind of relatedness between words is if they belong to the same\\nsemantic ﬁeld. A semantic ﬁeld is a set of words which cover a particular semantic\\nsemantic ﬁeld\\ndomain and bear structured relations with each other.

Semantic ﬁelds are also related to topic models, like Latent\\ntopic models\\nDirichlet Allocation, LDA, which apply unsupervised learning on large sets of texts\\nto induce sets of associated words from text. Semantic ﬁelds and topic models are\\nvery useful tools for discovering topical structure in documents.\\nIn Appendix G we’ll introduce more relations between senses like hypernymy\\nor IS-A, antonymy (opposites) and meronymy (part-whole relations).\\nConnotation\\nFinally, words have affective meanings or connotations. The word\\nconnotations\\nconnotation has different meanings in different ﬁelds, but here we use it to mean the\\naspects of a word’s meaning that are related to a writer or reader’s emotions, senti-\\nment, opinions, or evaluations. For example some words have positive connotations\\n(wonderful) while others have negative connotations (dreary). Even words whose\\nmeanings are similar in other ways can vary in connotation; consider the difference\\nin connotations between fake, knockoff, forgery, on the one hand, and copy, replica,\\nreproduction on the other, or innocent (positive connotation) and naive (negative\\nconnotation). Some words describe positive evaluation (great, love) and others neg-\\native evaluation (terrible, hate). Positive or negative evaluation language is called\\nsentiment, as we saw in Appendix K, and word sentiment plays a role in impor-\\nsentiment\\ntant tasks like sentiment analysis, stance detection, and applications of NLP to the\\nlanguage of politics and consumer reviews.\\nEarly work on affective meaning (Osgood et al., 1957) found that words varied\\nalong three important dimensions of affective meaning:\\nvalence: the pleasantness of the stimulus\\narousal: the intensity of emotion provoked by the stimulus\\ndominance: the degree of control exerted by the stimulus\\nThus words like happy or satisﬁed are high on valence, while unhappy or an-\\nnoyed are low on valence. Excited is high on arousal, while calm is low on arousal.\\nControlling is high on dominance, while awed or inﬂuenced are low on dominance.\\nEach word is thus represented by three numbers, corresponding to its value on each\\nof the three dimensions:\\nValence Arousal Dominance\\ncourageous 8.0\\n5.5\\n7.4\\nmusic\\n7.7\\n5.6\\n6.5\\nheartbreak\\n2.5\\n5.7\\n3.6\\ncub\\n6.7\\n4.0\\n4.2\\nOsgood et al. (1957) noticed that in using these 3 numbers to represent the\\nmeaning of a word, the model was representing each word as a point in a three-\\ndimensional space, a vector whose three dimensions corresponded to the word’s\\nrating on the three scales. This revolutionary idea that word meaning could be rep-\\nresented as a point in space (e.g., that part of the meaning of heartbreak can be\\nrepresented as the point [2.5,5.7,3.6]) was the ﬁrst expression of the vector seman-\\ntics models that we introduce next.\\n5.2\\nVector Semantics: The Intuition\\nVector semantics is the standard way to represent word meaning in NLP, helping\\nvector\\nsemantics'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.21', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2025-08-24T11:50:50-07:00', 'source': 'embeddings.pdf', 'file_path': 'data\\\\embeddings.pdf', 'total_pages': 27, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2025-08-24T11:50:50-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20250824115050-07'00'\", 'creationDate': \"D:20250824115050-07'00'\", 'page': 4}, page_content='5.2\\n•\\nVECTOR SEMANTICS: THE INTUITION\\n5\\nus model many of the aspects of word meaning we saw in the previous section. The\\nroots of the model lie in the 1950s when two big ideas converged: Osgood’s 1957\\nidea mentioned above to use a point in three-dimensional space to represent the\\nconnotation of a word, and the proposal by linguists like Joos (1950), Harris (1954),\\nand Firth (1957) to deﬁne the meaning of a word by its distribution in language\\nuse, meaning its neighboring words or grammatical environments. Their idea was\\nthat two words that occur in very similar distributions (whose neighboring words are\\nsimilar) have similar meanings.\\nFor example, suppose you didn’t know the meaning of the word ongchoi (a re-\\ncent borrowing from Cantonese) but you see it in the following contexts:\\n(5.1) Ongchoi is delicious sauteed with garlic.\\n(5.2) Ongchoi is superb over rice.\\n(5.3) ...ongchoi leaves with salty sauces...\\nAnd suppose that you had seen many of these context words in other contexts:\\n(5.4) ...spinach sauteed with garlic over rice...\\n(5.5) ...chard stems and leaves are delicious...\\n(5.6) ...collard greens and other salty leafy greens\\nThe fact that ongchoi occurs with words like rice and garlic and delicious and\\nsalty, as do words like spinach, chard, and collard greens might suggest that ongchoi\\nis a leafy green similar to these other leafy greens.1 We can implement the same\\nintuition computationally by just counting words in the context of ongchoi.\\nFigure 5.1\\nA two-dimensional (t-SNE) visualization of 200-dimensional word2vec em-\\nbeddings for some words close to the word sweet, showing that words with similar mean-\\nings are nearby in space.

And as\\nwe’ll see, vector semantic models like the ones showed in Fig. 5.1 can be learned\\nautomatically from text without supervision.\\nIn this chapter we’ll begin with a simple pedagogical model of embeddings in\\nwhich the meaning of a word is deﬁned by a vector with the counts of nearby words.\\nWe introduce this model as a helpful way to understand the concept of vectors and\\nwhat it means for a vector to be a representation of word meaning, but more sophis-\\nticated variants like the tf-idf model we will introduce in Chapter 11 are important\\nmethods you should understand. We will see that this method results in very long\\nvectors that are sparse, i.e. mostly zeros (since most words simply never occur in the\\ncontext of others). We’ll then introduce the word2vec model family for constructing\\nshort, dense vectors that have even more useful semantic properties.\\nWe’ll also introduce the cosine, the standard way to use embeddings to com-\\npute semantic similarity, between two words, two sentences, or two documents, an\\nimportant tool in practical applications.\\n5.3\\nSimple count-based embeddings\\n“The most important attributes of a vector in 3-space are {Location, Location, Location}”\\nRandall Munroe, the hover from https://xkcd.com/2358/\\nLet’s now introduce the ﬁrst way to compute word vector embeddings. This sim-\\nplest vector model of meaning is based on the co-occurrence matrix, a way of rep-\\nresenting how often words co-occur. We’ll deﬁne a particular kind of co-occurrence\\nmatrix, the word-context matrix, in which each row in the matrix represents a word\\nword-context\\nmatrix\\nin the vocabulary and each column represents how often each other word in the vo-\\ncabulary appears nearby. This matrix is thus of dimensionality |V| × |V| and each\\ncell records the number of times the row (target) word and the column (context)\\nword co-occur nearby in some training corpus.\\nWhat do we mean by ‘nearby’? We could implement various methods, but let’s\\nstart with a very simple one: a context window around the word, let’s say of 4 words\\nto the left and 4 words to the right. If we do that, each cell will represents the\\nnumber of times (in some training corpus) the column word occurs in such a ±4\\nword window around the row word.\\nLet’s see how this works for 4 words: cherry, strawberry, digital, and informa-\\ntion. For each word we took a single instance from a corpus, and we show the ±4\\nword window from that instance:\\nis traditionally followed by cherry\\npie, a traditional dessert\\noften mixed, such as strawberry\\nrhubarb pie.

Let’s therefore instead sketch the process\\non a smaller scale. Imagine that we are going to look at only the 4 words, and only\\nconsider the following 3 context words: a, computer, and pie. Furthermore let’s\\nassume we only count occurrences in the mini-corpus above.\\nSo before looking at Fig. 5.2, compute by hand the counts for these 3 context\\nwords for the four words cherry, strawberry, digital, and information.\\na\\ncomputer\\npie\\ncherry\\n1\\n0\\n1\\nstrawberry\\n0\\n0\\n2\\ndigital\\n0\\n1\\n0\\ninformation\\n1\\n1\\n0\\nFigure 5.2\\nCo-occurrence vectors for four words with counts from the 4 windows above,\\nshowing just 3 of the potential context word dimensions.

To review some basic linear\\nalgebra, a vector is, at heart, just a list or array of numbers. So cherry is represented\\nvector\\nas the list [1,0,1] (the ﬁrst row vector in Fig. 5.2) and information is represented as\\nthe list [1,1,0] (the fourth row vector).\\nA vector space is a collection of vectors, and is characterized by its dimension.\\nvector space\\ndimension\\nVectors in a 3-dimensional vector space have an element for each dimension of the\\nspace. We will loosely refer to a vector in a 3-dimensional space as a 3-dimensional\\nvector, with one element along each dimension. In the example in Fig. 5.2, we’ve\\nchosen to make the document vectors of dimension 3, just so they ﬁt on the page; in\\nreal term-document matrices, the document vectors would have dimensionality |V|,\\nthe vocabulary size.\\nThe ordering of the numbers in a vector space indicates the different dimensions\\non which documents vary. The third dimension for all these vectors corresponds\\nto the number of times pie occurs in the context. The second dimension for all of\\nthem corresponds to the number of times the word computer occurs.

But this is a problem; we’d like a similarity\\nmetric that tells us how similar two words are regardless of their frequency.\\nWe modify the dot product to normalize for the vector length by dividing the\\ndot product by the lengths of each of the two vectors.

We now introduce a more\\npowerful word representation: embeddings, short dense vectors. Unlike the vectors\\nwe’ve seen so far, embeddings are short, with number of dimensions d ranging from\\n50-1000, rather than the much larger vocabulary size |V|.These d dimensions don’t\\nhave a clear interpretation. And the vectors are dense: instead of vector entries\\nbeing sparse, mostly-zero counts or functions of counts, the values will be real-\\nvalued numbers that can be negative.\\nIt turns out that dense vectors work better in every NLP task than sparse vectors.\\nWhile we don’t completely understand all the reasons for this, we have some intu-\\nitions. Representing words as 300-dimensional dense vectors requires our classiﬁers\\nto learn far fewer weights than if we represented words as 50,000-dimensional vec-\\ntors, and the smaller parameter space possibly helps with generalization and avoid-\\ning overﬁtting. Dense vectors may also do a better job of capturing synonymy.\\nFor example, in a sparse vector representation, dimensions for synonyms like car\\nand automobile dimension are distinct and unrelated; sparse vectors may thus fail\\nto capture the similarity between a word with car as a neighbor and a word with\\nautomobile as a neighbor.\\nIn this section we introduce one method for computing embeddings: skip-gram\\nskip-gram\\nwith negative sampling, sometimes called SGNS.

Second, word2vec simpliﬁes the architecture (training a logistic regression\\nclassiﬁer instead of a multi-layer neural network with hidden layers that demand\\nmore sophisticated training algorithms). The intuition of skip-gram is:\\n1. Treat the target word and a neighboring context word as positive examples.\\n2. Randomly sample other words in the lexicon to get negative samples.\\n3.

To turn the dot product into a probability, we’ll use the logistic or sigmoid\\nfunction σ(x), the fundamental core of logistic regression:\\nσ(x) =\\n1\\n1+exp(−x)\\n(5.14)\\nWe model the probability that word c is a real context word for target word w as:\\nP(+|w,c) = σ(c·w) =\\n1\\n1+exp(−c·w)\\n(5.15)\\nThe sigmoid function returns a number between 0 and 1, but to make it a probability\\nwe’ll also need the total probability of the two possible events (c is a context word,\\nand c isn’t a context word) to sum to 1. We thus estimate the probability that word c\\nis not a real context word for w as:\\nP(−|w,c) = 1−P(+|w,c)\\n= σ(−c·w) =\\n1\\n1+exp(c·w)\\n(5.16)\\nEquation 5.15 gives us the probability for one word, but there are many context\\nwords in the window. Skip-gram makes the simplifying assumption that all context\\nwords are independent, allowing us to just multiply their probabilities:\\nP(+|w,c1:L) =\\nL\\nY\\ni=1\\nσ(ci ·w)\\n(5.17)\\nlogP(+|w,c1:L) =\\nL\\nX\\ni=1\\nlogσ(ci ·w)\\n(5.18)\\nIn summary, skip-gram trains a probabilistic classiﬁer that, given a test target word\\nw and its context window of L words c1:L, assigns a probability based on how similar\\nthis context window is to the target word. The probability is based on applying the\\nlogistic (sigmoid) function to the dot product of the embeddings of the target word\\nwith each context word. To compute this probability, we just need embeddings for\\neach target word and context word in the vocabulary.\\nFig. 5.6 shows the intuition of the parameters we’ll need. Skip-gram actually\\nstores two embeddings for each word, one for the word as a target, and one for the\\nword considered as context. Thus the parameters we need to learn are two matrices\\nW and C, each containing an embedding for every one of the |V| words in the\\nvocabulary V.2 Let’s now turn to learning these embeddings (which is the real goal\\nof training this classiﬁer in the ﬁrst place).\\n2\\nIn principle the target matrix and the context matrix could use different vocabularies, but we’ll simplify\\nby assuming one shared vocabulary V.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.21', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2025-08-24T11:50:50-07:00', 'source': 'embeddings.pdf', 'file_path': 'data\\\\embeddings.pdf', 'total_pages': 27, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2025-08-24T11:50:50-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20250824115050-07'00'\", 'creationDate': \"D:20250824115050-07'00'\", 'page': 12}, page_content='5.5\\n•\\nWORD2VEC\\n13\\n1\\nW\\nC\\naardvark\\nzebra\\nzebra\\naardvark\\napricot\\napricot\\n|V|\\n|V|+1\\n2|V|\\n𝜽 =\\ntarget words\\ncontext & noise\\nwords\\n…\\n…\\n1..d\\n…\\n…\\nFigure 5.6\\nThe embeddings learned by the skipgram model.

So for each of these\\n(w,cpos) training instances we’ll create k negative samples, each consisting of the\\ntarget w plus a ‘noise word’ cneg. A noise word is a random word from the lexicon,\\nconstrained not to be the target word w.

An extension of word2vec, fasttext\\nfasttext\\n(Bojanowski et al., 2017), addresses a problem with word2vec as we have presented\\nit so far: it has no good way to deal with unknown words—words that appear in\\na test corpus but were unseen in the training corpus. A related problem is word\\nsparsity, such as in languages with rich morphology, where some of the many forms\\nfor each noun and verb may only occur rarely. Fasttext deals with these problems\\nby using subword models, representing each word as itself plus a bag of constituent\\nn-grams, with special boundary symbols < and > added to each word. For example,\\nwith n = 3 the word where would be represented by the sequence <where> plus the\\ncharacter n-grams:\\n<wh, whe, her, ere, re>\\nThen a skipgram embedding is learned for each constituent n-gram, and the word\\nwhere is represented by the sum of all of the embeddings of its constituent n-grams.\\nUnknown words can then be presented only by the sum of the constituent n-grams.\\nA fasttext open-source library, including pretrained embeddings for 157 languages,\\nis available at https://fasttext.cc.\\nAnother very widely used static embedding model is GloVe (Pennington et al.,\\n2014), short for Global Vectors, because the model is based on capturing global\\ncorpus statistics. GloVe is based on ratios of probabilities from the word-word co-\\noccurrence matrix.\\nIt turns out that dense embeddings like word2vec actually have an elegant math-\\nematical relationship with count-based embeddings, in which word2vec can be seen\\nas implicitly optimizing a function of a count matrix with a particular (PPMI) weight-\\ning (Levy and Goldberg, 2014c).\\n5.6\\nVisualizing Embeddings\\n“I see well in many dimensions as long as the dimensions are around two.”\\nThe late economist Martin Shubik\\nVisualizing embeddings is an important goal in helping understand, apply, and\\nimprove these models of word meaning.

Fig. 5.1 showed one such visualization, as does\\nFig. 5.9, using a projection method called t-SNE (van der\\nMaaten and Hinton, 2008).\\n5.7\\nSemantic properties of embeddings\\nIn this section we brieﬂy summarize some of the semantic properties of embeddings\\nthat have been studied.\\nDifferent types of similarity or association:\\nOne parameter of vector semantic\\nmodels that is relevant to both sparse PPMI vectors and dense word2vec vectors is\\nthe size of the context window used to collect counts. This is generally between 1\\nand 10 words on each side of the target word (for a total context of 2-20 words).\\nThe choice depends on the goals of the representation. Shorter context windows\\ntend to lead to representations that are a bit more syntactic, since the information is\\ncoming from immediately nearby words. When the vectors are computed from short\\ncontext windows, the most similar words to a target word w tend to be semantically\\nsimilar words with the same parts of speech. When vectors are computed from long\\ncontext windows, the highest cosine words to a target word w tend to be words that\\nare topically related but not similar.\\nFor example Levy and Goldberg (2014a) showed that using skip-gram with a\\nwindow of ±2, the most similar words to the word Hogwarts (from the Harry Potter\\nseries) were names of other ﬁctional schools: Sunnydale (from Buffy the Vampire\\nSlayer) or Evernight (from a vampire series). With a window of ±5, the most similar\\nwords to Hogwarts were other words topically related to the Harry Potter series:\\nDumbledore, Malfoy, and half-blood.\\nIt’s also often useful to distinguish two kinds of similarity or association between\\nwords (Sch¨utze and Pedersen, 1993). Two words have ﬁrst-order co-occurrence\\nﬁrst-order\\nco-occurrence\\n(sometimes called syntagmatic association) if they are typically nearby each other.\\nThus wrote is a ﬁrst-order associate of book or poem. Two words have second-order\\nco-occurrence (sometimes called paradigmatic association) if they have similar\\nsecond-order\\nco-occurrence\\nneighbors. Thus wrote is a second-order associate of words like said or remarked.\\nAnalogy/Relational Similarity:\\nAnother semantic property of embeddings is their\\nability to capture relational meanings. In an important early vector space model of\\ncognition, Rumelhart and Abrahamson (1973) proposed the parallelogram model\\nparallelogram\\nmodel\\nfor solving simple analogy problems of the form a is to b as a* is to what?. In such\\nproblems, a system is given a problem like apple:tree::grape:?, i.e., apple is to tree\\nas grape is to\\n, and must ﬁll in the word vine. In the parallelogram model, il-\\nlustrated in Fig. 5.8, the vector from the word apple to the word tree (= #   »\\ntree−#       »\\napple)\\nis added to the vector for grape (#        »\\ngrape); the nearest word to that point is returned.\\nIn early work with sparse embeddings, scholars showed that sparse vector mod-\\nels of meaning could solve such analogy problems (Turney and Littman, 2005),\\nbut the parallelogram method received more modern attention because of its suc-\\ncess with word2vec or GloVe vectors (Mikolov et al. 2013c, Levy and Goldberg\\n2014b, Pennington et al. 2014). For example, the result of the expression #     »\\nking −\\n#     »\\nman + #            »\\nwoman is a vector close to #         »\\nqueen.

For example Fig. 5.10 shows a visualization of changes in meaning in\\nEnglish words over the last two centuries, computed by building separate embedding\\nspaces for each decade from historical corpora like Google n-grams (Lin et al., 2012)\\nand the Corpus of Historical American English (Davies, 2012).\\nFigure 5.10\\nA t-SNE visualization of the semantic change of 3 words in English using\\nword2vec vectors. The modern sense of each word, and the grey context words, are com-\\nputed from the most recent (modern) time-point embedding space. Earlier points are com-\\nputed from earlier historical embedding spaces. The visualizations show the changes in the\\nword gay from meanings related to “cheerful” or “frolicsome” to referring to homosexuality,\\nthe development of the modern “transmission” sense of broadcast from its original sense of\\nsowing seeds, and the pejoration of the word awful as it shifted from meaning “full of awe”\\nto meaning “terrible or appalling” (Hamilton et al., 2016).\\n5.8\\nBias and Embeddings\\nIn addition to their ability to learn word meaning from text, embeddings, alas,\\nalso reproduce the implicit biases and stereotypes that were latent in the text. As\\nthe prior section just showed, embeddings can roughly model relational similar-\\nity: ‘queen’ as the closest word to ‘king’ - ‘man’ + ‘woman’ implies the analogy\\nman:woman::king:queen. But these same embedding analogies also exhibit gender\\nstereotypes. For example Bolukbasi et al. (2016) ﬁnd that the closest occupation\\nto ‘computer programmer’ - ‘man’ + ‘woman’ in word2vec embeddings trained on\\nnews text is ‘homemaker’, and that the embeddings similarly suggest the analogy\\n‘father’ is to ‘doctor’ as ‘mother’ is to ‘nurse’. This could result in what Crawford\\n(2017) and Blodgett et al. (2020) call an allocational harm, when a system allo-\\nallocational\\nharm\\ncates resources (jobs or credit) unfairly to different groups. For example algorithms\\nthat use embeddings as part of a search for hiring potential programmers or doctors\\nmight thus incorrectly downweight documents with women’s names.\\nIt turns out that embeddings don’t just reﬂect the statistics of their input, but also\\namplify bias; gendered terms become more gendered in embedding space than they\\nbias\\nampliﬁcation\\nwere in the input text statistics (Zhao et al. 2017, Ethayarajh et al. 2019b, Jia et al.\\n2020), and biases are more exaggerated than in actual labor employment statistics\\n(Garg et al., 2018).\\nEmbeddings also encode the implicit associations that are a property of human\\nreasoning.

For example African-American\\nnames like ‘Leroy’ and ‘Shaniqua’ had a higher GloVe cosine with unpleasant words\\nwhile European-American names (‘Brad’, ‘Greg’, ‘Courtney’) had a higher cosine\\nwith pleasant words. These problems with embeddings are an example of a repre-\\nsentational harm (Crawford 2017, Blodgett et al. 2020), which is a harm caused by\\nrepresentational\\nharm\\na system demeaning or even ignoring some social groups. Any embedding-aware al-\\ngorithm that made use of word sentiment could thus exacerbate bias against African\\nAmericans.\\nRecent research focuses on ways to try to remove these kinds of biases, for\\nexample by developing a transformation of the embedding space that removes gen-\\nder stereotypes but preserves deﬁnitional gender (Bolukbasi et al. 2016, Zhao et al.\\n2017) or changing the training procedure (Zhao et al., 2018). However, although\\nthese sorts of debiasing may reduce bias in embeddings, they do not eliminate it\\ndebiasing\\n(Gonen and Goldberg, 2019), and this remains an open problem.\\nHistorical embeddings are also being used to measure biases in the past. Garg\\net al. (2018) used embeddings from historical texts to measure the association be-\\ntween embeddings for occupations and embeddings for names of various ethnici-\\nties or genders (for example the relative cosine similarity of women’s names versus\\nmen’s to occupation words like ‘librarian’ or ‘carpenter’) across the 20th century.\\nThey found that the cosines correlate with the empirical historical percentages of\\nwomen or ethnic groups in those occupations. Historical embeddings also repli-\\ncated old surveys of ethnic stereotypes; the tendency of experimental participants in\\n1933 to associate adjectives like ‘industrious’ or ‘superstitious’ with, e.g., Chinese\\nethnicity, correlates with the cosine between Chinese last names and those adjectives\\nusing embeddings trained on 1930s text. They also were able to document historical\\ngender biases, such as the fact that embeddings for adjectives related to competence\\n(‘smart’, ‘wise’, ‘thoughtful’, ‘resourceful’) had a higher cosine with male than fe-\\nmale words, and showed that this bias has been slowly decreasing since 1960. We\\nreturn in later chapters to this question about the role of bias in natural language\\nprocessing.\\n5.9\\nEvaluating Vector Models\\nThe most important evaluation metric for vector models is extrinsic evaluation on\\ntasks, i.e., using vectors in an NLP task and seeing whether this improves perfor-\\nmance over some other model.\\n3\\nRoughly speaking, if humans associate ‘ﬂowers’ with ‘pleasantness’ and ‘insects’ with ‘unpleasant-\\nness’, when they are instructed to push a green button for ‘ﬂowers’ (daisy, iris, lilac) and ‘pleasant words’\\n(love, laughter, pleasure) and a red button for ‘insects’ (ﬂea, spider, mosquito) and ‘unpleasant words’\\n(abuse, hatred, ugly) they are faster than in an incongruous condition where they push a red button for\\n‘ﬂowers’ and ‘unpleasant words’ and a green button for ‘insects’ and ‘pleasant words’.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.21', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2025-08-24T11:50:50-07:00', 'source': 'embeddings.pdf', 'file_path': 'data\\\\embeddings.pdf', 'total_pages': 27, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2025-08-24T11:50:50-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20250824115050-07'00'\", 'creationDate': \"D:20250824115050-07'00'\", 'page': 20}, page_content='5.10\\n•\\nSUMMARY\\n21\\nNonetheless it is useful to have intrinsic evaluations. The most common metric\\nis to test their performance on similarity, computing the correlation between an\\nalgorithm’s word similarity scores and word similarity ratings assigned by humans.\\nWordSim-353 (Finkelstein et al., 2002) is a commonly used set of ratings from 0\\nto 10 for 353 noun pairs; for example (plane, car) had an average score of 5.77.\\nSimLex-999 (Hill et al., 2015) is a more complex dataset that quantiﬁes similarity\\n(cup, mug) rather than relatedness (cup, coffee), and includes concrete and abstract\\nadjective, noun and verb pairs. The TOEFL dataset is a set of 80 questions, each\\nconsisting of a target word with 4 additional word choices; the task is to choose\\nwhich is the correct synonym, as in the example: Levied is closest in meaning to:\\nimposed, believed, requested, correlated (Landauer and Dumais, 1997). All of these\\ndatasets present words without context.\\nSlightly more realistic are intrinsic similarity tasks that include context. The\\nStanford Contextual Word Similarity (SCWS) dataset (Huang et al., 2012) and the\\nWord-in-Context (WiC) dataset (Pilehvar and Camacho-Collados, 2019) offer richer\\nevaluation scenarios. SCWS gives human judgments on 2,003 pairs of words in\\ntheir sentential context, while WiC gives target words in two sentential contexts that\\nare either in the same or different senses; see Appendix G. The semantic textual\\nsimilarity task (Agirre et al. 2012, Agirre et al. 2015) evaluates the performance of\\nsentence-level similarity algorithms, consisting of a set of pairs of sentences, each\\npair with human-labeled similarity scores.\\nAnother task used for evaluation is the analogy task, discussed on page 17, where\\nthe system has to solve problems of the form a is to b as a* is to b*, given a, b, and a*\\nand having to ﬁnd b* (Turney and Littman, 2005). A number of sets of tuples have\\nbeen created for this task (Mikolov et al. 2013a, Mikolov et al. 2013c, Gladkova\\net al. 2016), covering morphology (city:cities::child:children), lexicographic rela-\\ntions (leg:table::spout:teapot) and encyclopedia relations (Beijing:China::Dublin:Ireland),\\nsome drawing from the SemEval-2012 Task 2 dataset of 79 different relations (Jur-\\ngens et al., 2012).\\nAll embedding algorithms suffer from inherent variability. For example because\\nof randomness in the initialization and the random negative sampling, algorithms\\nlike word2vec may produce different results even from the same dataset, and in-\\ndividual documents in a collection may strongly impact the resulting embeddings\\n(Tian et al. 2016, Hellrich and Hahn 2016, Antoniak and Mimno 2018). When em-\\nbeddings are used to study word associations in particular corpora, therefore, it is\\nbest practice to train multiple embeddings with bootstrap sampling over documents\\nand average the results (Antoniak and Mimno, 2018).\\n5.10\\nSummary\\n• In vector semantics, a word is modeled as a vector—a point in high-dimensional\\nspace, also called an embedding. In this chapter we focus on static embed-\\ndings, where each word is mapped to a ﬁxed embedding.\\n• Vector semantic models fall into two classes: sparse and dense. In sparse\\nmodels each dimension corresponds to a word in the vocabulary V and cells\\nare functions of co-occurrence counts. The word-context or term-term ma-\\ntrix has a row for each (target) word in the vocabulary and a column for each\\ncontext term in the vocabulary.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.21', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2025-08-24T11:50:50-07:00', 'source': 'embeddings.pdf', 'file_path': 'data\\\\embeddings.pdf', 'total_pages': 27, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2025-08-24T11:50:50-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20250824115050-07'00'\", 'creationDate': \"D:20250824115050-07'00'\", 'page': 21}, page_content='22\\nCHAPTER 5\\n•\\nEMBEDDINGS\\n• Dense vector models typically have dimensionality 50–1000. Word2vec al-\\ngorithms like skip-gram are a popular way to compute dense embeddings.\\nSkip-gram trains a logistic regression classiﬁer to compute the probability that\\ntwo words are ‘likely to occur nearby in text’. This probability is computed\\nfrom the dot product between the embeddings for the two words.\\n• Skip-gram uses stochastic gradient descent to train the classiﬁer, by learning\\nembeddings that have a high dot product with embeddings of words that occur\\nnearby and a low dot product with noise words.\\n• Other important embedding algorithms include GloVe, a method based on\\nratios of word co-occurrence probabilities.\\n• Whether using sparse or dense vectors, word and document similarities are\\ncomputed by some function of the dot product between vectors. The cosine\\nof two vectors—a normalized dot product—is the most popular such metric.\\nHistorical Notes\\nThe idea of vector semantics arose out of research in the 1950s in three distinct\\nﬁelds: linguistics, psychology, and computer science, each of which contributed a\\nfundamental aspect of the model.\\nThe idea that meaning is related to the distribution of words in context was\\nwidespread in linguistic theory of the 1950s, among distributionalists like Zellig\\nHarris, Martin Joos, and J. R. Firth, and semioticians like Thomas Sebeok. As Joos\\n(1950) put it,\\nthe linguist’s “meaning” of a morpheme. . . is by deﬁnition the set of conditional\\nprobabilities of its occurrence in context with all other morphemes.\\nThe idea that the meaning of a word might be modeled as a point in a multi-\\ndimensional semantic space came from psychologists like Charles E. Osgood, who\\nhad been studying how people responded to the meaning of words by assigning val-\\nues along scales like happy/sad or hard/soft. Osgood et al. (1957) proposed that the\\nmeaning of a word in general could be modeled as a point in a multidimensional\\nEuclidean space, and that the similarity of meaning between two words could be\\nmodeled as the distance between these points in the space.\\nA ﬁnal intellectual source in the 1950s and early 1960s was the ﬁeld then called\\nmechanical indexing, now known as information retrieval. In what became known\\nmechanical\\nindexing\\nas the vector space model for information retrieval (Salton 1971, Sparck Jones\\n1986), researchers demonstrated new ways to deﬁne the meaning of words in terms\\nof vectors (Switzer, 1965), and reﬁned methods for word similarity based on mea-\\nsures of statistical association between words like mutual information (Giuliano,\\n1965) and idf (Sparck Jones, 1972), and showed that the meaning of documents\\ncould be represented in the same vector spaces used for words. Around the same\\ntime, (Cordier, 1965) showed that factor analysis of word association probabilities\\ncould be used to form dense vector representations of words.\\nSome of the philosophical underpinning of the distributional way of thinking\\ncame from the late writings of the philosopher Wittgenstein, who was skeptical of\\nthe possibility of building a completely formal theory of meaning deﬁnitions for\\neach word. Wittgenstein suggested instead that “the meaning of a word is its use in\\nthe language” (Wittgenstein, 1953, PI 43). That is, instead of using some logical lan-\\nguage to deﬁne each word, or drawing on denotations or truth values, Wittgenstein’s'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.21', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2025-08-24T11:50:50-07:00', 'source': 'embeddings.pdf', 'file_path': 'data\\\\embeddings.pdf', 'total_pages': 27, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2025-08-24T11:50:50-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20250824115050-07'00'\", 'creationDate': \"D:20250824115050-07'00'\", 'page': 22}, page_content='HISTORICAL NOTES\\n23\\nidea is that we should deﬁne a word by how it is used by people in speaking and un-\\nderstanding in their day-to-day interactions, thus preﬁguring the movement toward\\nembodied and experiential models in linguistics and NLP (Glenberg and Robertson\\n2000, Lake and Murphy 2021, Bisk et al. 2020, Bender and Koller 2020).\\nMore distantly related is the idea of deﬁning words by a vector of discrete fea-\\ntures, which has roots at least as far back as Descartes and Leibniz (Wierzbicka 1992,\\nWierzbicka 1996). By the middle of the 20th century, beginning with the work of\\nHjelmslev (Hjelmslev, 1969) (originally 1943) and ﬂeshed out in early models of\\ngenerative grammar (Katz and Fodor, 1963), the idea arose of representing mean-\\ning with semantic features, symbols that represent some sort of primitive meaning.\\nsemantic\\nfeature\\nFor example words like hen, rooster, or chick, have something in common (they all\\ndescribe chickens) and something different (their age and sex), representable as:\\nhen\\n+female, +chicken, +adult\\nrooster -female, +chicken, +adult\\nchick\\n+chicken, -adult\\nThe dimensions used by vector models of meaning to deﬁne words, however, are\\nonly abstractly related to this idea of a small ﬁxed number of hand-built dimensions.\\nNonetheless, there has been some attempt to show that certain dimensions of em-\\nbedding models do contribute some speciﬁc compositional aspect of meaning like\\nthese early semantic features.\\nThe use of dense vectors to model word meaning, and indeed the term embed-\\nding, grew out of the latent semantic indexing (LSI) model (Deerwester et al.,\\n1988) recast as LSA (latent semantic analysis) (Deerwester et al., 1990). In LSA\\nsingular value decomposition—SVD— is applied to a term-document matrix (each\\nSVD\\ncell weighted by log frequency and normalized by entropy), and then the ﬁrst 300\\ndimensions are used as the LSA embedding. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)\\nis a method for ﬁnding the most important dimensions of a data set, those dimen-\\nsions along which the data varies the most. LSA was then quickly widely applied:\\nas a cognitive model (Landauer and Dumais, 1997), and for tasks like spell checking\\n(Jones and Martin, 1997), language modeling (Bellegarda 1997, Coccaro and Ju-\\nrafsky 1998, Bellegarda 2000), morphology induction (Schone and Jurafsky 2000,\\nSchone and Jurafsky 2001b), multiword expressions (MWEs) (Schone and Jurafsky,\\n2001a), and essay grading (Rehder et al., 1998). Related models were simultane-\\nously developed and applied to word sense disambiguation by Sch¨utze (1992). LSA\\nalso led to the earliest use of embeddings to represent words in a probabilistic clas-\\nsiﬁer, in the logistic regression document router of Sch¨utze et al. (1995). The idea of\\nSVD on the term-term matrix (rather than the term-document matrix) as a model of\\nmeaning for NLP was proposed soon after LSA by Sch¨utze (1992). Sch¨utze applied\\nthe low-rank (97-dimensional) embeddings produced by SVD to the task of word\\nsense disambiguation, analyzed the resulting semantic space, and also suggested\\npossible techniques like dropping high-order dimensions. See Sch¨utze (1997).\\nA number of alternative matrix models followed on from the early SVD work,\\nincluding Probabilistic Latent Semantic Indexing (PLSI) (Hofmann, 1999), Latent\\nDirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003), and Non-negative Matrix Factoriza-\\ntion (NMF) (Lee and Seung, 1999).\\nThe LSA community seems to have ﬁrst used the word “embedding” in Landauer\\net al. (1997), in a variant of its mathematical meaning as a mapping from one space\\nor mathematical structure to another. In LSA, the word embedding seems to have\\ndescribed the mapping from the space of sparse count vectors to the latent space of\\nSVD dense vectors.

Collobert and Weston (2007), Collobert and Weston (2008), and\\nCollobert et al. (2011) then demonstrated that embeddings could be used to represent\\nword meanings for a number of NLP tasks.

How should\\nwe represent the meaning of a word? In the n-gram models of Chapter 3, and in\\nclassical NLP applications, our only representation of a word is as a string of letters,\\nor an index in a vocabulary list. This representation is not that different from a\\ntradition in philosophy, perhaps you’ve seen it in introductory logic classes, in which\\nthe meaning of words is represented by just spelling the word with small capital\\nletters; representing the meaning of “dog” as DOG, and “cat” as CAT, or by using an\\napostrophe (DOG’).\\nRepresenting the meaning of a word by capitalizing it is a pretty unsatisfactory\\nmodel. You might have seen a version of a joke due originally to semanticist Barbara\\nPartee (Carlson, 1977):\\nQ: What’s the meaning of life?\\nA: LIFE’\\nSurely we can do better than this!
